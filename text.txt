# THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY


# Preface


Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.

Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety­‐two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape­‐descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.

This planet has — or rather had — a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.

Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.

And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.

Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.

Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.

But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply. It begins with a house.


# Chapter 1


Not a remarkable house by any means — it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye.

The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about.

It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock down his house and build an bypass instead.

At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very good.

He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash.

Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn.

The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with.

"Yellow," he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed.

Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path.

the only vestiges left in Mr. L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats.

Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.

"What do you mean, why's it got to be built?" he said. "It's a bypass. You've got to build bypasses."

"Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard."

"Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?"

By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape­‐descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually claimed.

Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.

He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but a harmless one — an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance he would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun of any astrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out.

Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing.

Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn't matter that much really.

Thereafter, staggering semi­‐paralytic down the night streets he would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse.

"I'm trying to baby, I'm trying to," is what Ford invariably replied on these occasions.

Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth.

He knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan dollars a day.

The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in.

"What?" said Arthur Dent.

"Look, don't you understand?" shouted Arthur. He pointed at Prosser. "That man wants to knock my house down!"

Ford glanced at him, puzzled.

"Oh don't give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No, don't you give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ For my head will fly, my tongue will lie, my eyes will fry and I may die/ Won't you pour me one more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit"

Ford Prefect usually played to lose.

"In, as you say it, the mud."

As soon as Mr. Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it. He sighed.

"And no sneaky knocking down Mr. Dent's house whilst he's away, alright?" he said.

"The mere thought," growled Mr. Prosser, "hadn't even begun to speculate," he continued, settling himself back, "about the merest possibility of crossing my mind."

Arthur remained very worried.


# Chapter 2


the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.

Drink... but... very carefully...

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than the Encyclopedia Galactica.

"Six pints of bitter," said Ford Prefect to the barman of the Horse and Groom. "And quickly please, the world's about to end."

"No, no," said Ford, "it's just that the world's about to end."

"Ford," said Arthur, "would you please tell me what the hell is going on?"

"Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so."

"Did I do anything wrong today," he said, "or has the world always been like this and I've been too wrapped up in myself to notice?"

Arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile. The rest of the pub frowned at him. A man waved at him to stop smiling at them and mind his own business.

"This must be Thursday," said Arthur musing to himself, sinking low over his beer, "I never could get the hang of Thursdays."


# Chapter 3


On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds.

It looked insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words DON'T PANIC printed on it in large friendly letters. 

A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have.

the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you — daft as a bush, but very ravenous)

"Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who really knows where his towel is." (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.)

"You got a towel with you?" said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur.

Ford clicked his tongue in irritation.

"It's probably just your house being knocked down," said Ford, drowning his last pint.

The barman cleared his throat. He heard himself say: "Last orders, please."

"What the hell's that?" he shrieked.

Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn't it just have to be the Vogons.

He knew where his towel was.

And still nothing happened.

"People of Earth, your attention please," a voice said, and it was wonderful. Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep.

Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth.

"What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? For heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout.

The Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry void.


# Chapter 4


It was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy. Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox? Not the President?

Many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas.

Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex­‐hippy, good timer, (crook? quite possibly), manic self­‐publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch.

Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it.

He was roughly humanoid in appearance except for the extra head and third arm. 

Zaphod smiled, picturing himself.

The President of the Galaxy had arrived.

The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it.

"That is really amazing," he said. "That really is truly amazing. That is so amazingly amazing I think I'd like to steal it."


# Chapter 5


Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was thoroughly vile. Also, he did not like hitchhikers.

"Whhhrrrr..." said Arthur Dent.

"How do you feel?" he asked. "Like a military academy," said Arthur, "bits of me keep on passing out."

"We hitched a lift," said Ford.

"Good grief," said Arthur, "is this really the interior of a flying saucer?"

"I like the cover," he said. "Don't Panic. It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day."

"On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you."

"Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I intended," said Ford. "I came for a week and got stuck for fifteen years."

"Look," said Arthur, "I'm a bit upset about that."

"You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxy's a fun place. You'll need to have this fish in your ear."


# Chapter 6


"Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh should have a good time."

"I worked hard to get where I am today, and I didn't become captain of a Vogon constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxi service for a load of degenerate freeloaders."

"Charming man," he said. "I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one..."

"They've got as much sex appeal as a road accident."

"What's so unpleasant about being drunk?" "You ask a glass of water."

'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanished in a puff of logic.

"Ford!"

"And what does it say now?" asked Arthur. "Mostly harmless," admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed cough.

"Well," said Ford, "if we're lucky it's just the Vogons come to throw us in to space."

"If we're unlucky," said Ford grimly, "the captain might be serious in his threat that he's going to read us some of his poetry first..."


# Chapter 7


Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe.

The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England in the destruction of the planet Earth.

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence of muscle movements.

The prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation Chairs — strapped in.

The Vogon began to read — a fetid little passage of his own devising.

"Nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh!" cried Ford Prefect

"I present you with a simple choice! Either die in the vacuum of space, or..." he paused for melodramatic effect, "tell me how good you thought my poem was!"

"So what you're saying is that I write poetry because underneath my mean callous heartless exterior I really just want to be loved," he said. He paused. "Is that right?"

"I just write poetry to throw my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief."

Arthur stared round him wildly.

"Death's too good for them," he said.

"My God," complained Arthur, "you're talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished today."

"Who said anything about panicking?" snapped Arthur. "This is still just the culture shock. You wait till I've settled down into the situation and found my bearings. Then I'll start panicking."

"Resistance is useless!"

"Eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..." said the guard

"No, I think if it's all the same to you," he said, "I'd better get you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other bits of shouting I've got to do."

"Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn..." said Arthur without any clear inflection.

"You see if I keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior Shouting Officer, and there aren't usually many vacancies for non­‐shouting and non­‐pushing­‐people­‐about officers, so I think I'd better stick to what I know."

"Da da da dum! Doesn't that stir anything in you?"

"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die."


# Chapter 8


"Space," it says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen..." and so on.

However it goes on to say that what with space being the mind boggling size it is the chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to the power of two hundred and sixty­‐seven thousand seven hundred and nine to one against.


# Chapter 9


A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a nothingth of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of million light years from end to end.

On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like half­‐spent fish.

"Well, perhaps we're both going mad."

"Two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling"

"Haaaauuurrgghhh..." said Arthur as he felt his body softening and bending in unusual directions. 

"Ford," he said, "you're turning into a penguin. Stop it."

"Welcome," the voice said, "to the Starship Heart of Gold."

"Ford!" he said, "there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out."


# Chapter 10


The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace.

Many respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand for this — partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.

It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute's Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they really couldn't stand was a smartass.


# Chapter 11


In one corner a robot sat humped, its gleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel knees.

"Five to one against and falling..." she said, "four to one against and falling... three to one... two... one... probability factor of one to one... we have normality, I repeat we have normality."

"Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem."

"Just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space," she said. "Section ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha."

"OK, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, yeah?"

Trillian had come to suspect that the main reason why he had had such a wild and successful life was that he never really understood the significance of anything he did.

"But that's incredible." "No Zaphod. Just very very improbable."

"Er, yeah."

In the corner, the robot's head swung up sharply, but then wobbled about imperceptibly. It pulled itself up to its feet as if it was about five pounds heavier that it actually was, and made what an outside observer would have thought was a heroic effort to cross the room.

"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said. Its voice was low and hopeless.

"Oh God," muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seat.

With a microsecond pause, and a finely calculated micromodulation of pitch and timbre — nothing you could actually take offence at — Marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all things human.

"I won't enjoy it," said Marvin.

"I'm not getting you down at all am I?" he said pathetically.

"Life," said Marvin, "don't talk to me about life."

"I don't think I can stand that robot much longer Zaphod," growled Trillian.

The Encyclopaedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus designed to do the work of a man. The marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as "Your Plastic Pal Who's Fun To Be With."

"Oh," said Arthur, "sounds ghastly."

"Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah!" it said.

"Come on," he droned, "I've been ordered to take you down to the bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't."

"You watch this door," he muttered, "it's about to open again. I can tell by the intolerable air of smugness it suddenly generates."

"Zaphod Beeblebrox...?" he said weakly.

"Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed. Here's another of those self­‐satisfied door. Life! Don't talk to me about life."

Ford stared at him. "Did that robot say Zaphod Beeblebrox?" he said.


# Chapter 12


"And the question everyone's asking is... has the big Z finally flipped?"

"Well, Zaphod's jist zis guy you know?"

"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now."

He prefered people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous. 

"Oh God," said Zaphod. He hadn't worked with this computer for long but had already learned to loathe it.

Trillian punched up the figures. They showed two­‐to­‐the power­‐of­‐Infinity­‐minus­‐one (an irrational number that only has a conventional meaning in Improbability physics).

"I don't know," said Trillian, "but those aliens — they're on the way up to the bridge with that wretched robot. Can we pick them up on any monitor cameras?"


# Chapter 13


Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning.

"... and then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left hand side..."

"Well well well," he kept saying to himself, "Zaphod Beeblebrox..."

"I was told to take you to the bridge. Probably the highest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities today I shouldn't wonder."

"Thank you," it said, "for making a simple door very happy."

Deep in Marvin's thorax gears ground.

"Funny," he intoned funerally, "how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does."

"Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I'm standing?"

Ford was not going to be outcooled.

"Zaphod," he drawled, "great to see you, you're looking well, the extra arm suits you. Nice ship you've stolen."

"Oh sure," said Zaphod, "hi Arthur, glad you could make it." His right­‐hand head looked round casually, said "hi" and went back to having his teeth picked.

"What do you mean you've met?" he demanded. "This is Zaphod Beeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you know, not bloody Martin Smith from Croydon."

"We've met, haven't we Zaphod Beeblebrox — or should I say... Phil?"

"Hey doll, is this guy boring you? Why don't you talk to me instead? I'm from a different planet."

"Yes," said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel foolish. "He only had the two arms and the one head and he called himself Phil, but..."

"Tricia McMillian?" he said. "What are you doing here?"

"Trillian," he said, "is this sort of thing going to happen every time we use the Improbability drive?" "Very probably, I'm afraid," she said.


# Chapter 14


crew of four were ill at ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious principle of physics — as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and molecules

Ford couldn't sleep. He was too excited about being back on the road again.

He attacked everything in life with a mixture of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often difficult to tell which was which.

Arthur slept: he was terribly tired.

"There's a planet out there. It's at the exact coordinates you predicted."

Zaphod laughed. He was clearly very excited about something, almost childishly so.

"That..." said Zaphod, "is the most improbable planet that ever existed."


# Chapter 15


Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax free.

And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before — and thus was the Empire forged.

Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor — at least no one worth speaking of.

And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of specialist industry: custom­‐made luxury planet building.

The home of this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into dream planets — gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber planets with lots of earthquakes

In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of it.


# Chapter 16


"Magrathea is a myth, a fairy story, it's what parents tell their kids about at night if they want them to grow up to become economists, it's..."

"Hi there! This is Eddie your shipboard computer, and I'm feeling just great guys, and I know I'm just going to get a bundle of kicks out of any programme you care to run through me."

"I can even work out you personality problems to ten decimal places if it will help."

Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important.

"Is there any tea on this spaceship?" he asked.

Clearly, it was very very old.

One of Zaphod's heads looked away. The other one looked round to see what the first was looking at, but it wasn't looking at anything very much.

"You know I don't like the look of that planet at all," said Trillian shivering.

"I think it's just a dead planet," he said.

Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of the Galaxy


# Chapter 17


He had found a Nutri­‐Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.

It suddenly occurred to him to ask a question which had been bothering him. "Is it safe?" he said.

"Magrathea's been dead for five million years," said Zaphod, "of course it's safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now."

At which point a strange and inexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge — a noise as of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound. It preceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and insubstantial. The voice said "Greetings to you..."

"What the photon is it?"

"Just keep cool," said Zaphod.

"impact minus forty­‐five seconds. Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax."

The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they thundered towards the ship.

"This is it," said Arthur watching them. "We are now quite definitely going to die aren't we?"


# Chapter 18


Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, "What the hell happened?"

"They would appear," said Ford doubtfully, "to have turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale..."

Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet.

Ooooh, it's getting quite strong. And hey, what's about this whistling roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that... wind!

Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy with anticipation... Or is it the wind? There really is a lot of that now isn't it?

And wow! Hey! What's this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast? Very very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like... ow... ound... round... ground! That's it! That's a good name — ground! I wonder if it will be friends with me?

And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence.

Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now.


# Chapter 19


"Are we taking this robot with us?" said Ford, looking with distaste at Marvin who was standing in an awkward hunched posture in the corner under a small palm tree.

"But what are supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?"

"You think you've got problems," said Marvin

"It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level."

"My white mice have escaped!" she said.

An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of Zaphod's faces.

It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater attention had it been generally realized that human beings were only the third most intelligent life form present on the planet Earth, instead of (as was generally thought by most independent observers) the second.

Ford carried on counting quietly. This is about the most aggressive thing you can do to a computer, the equivalent of going up to a human being and saying Blood... blood... blood... blood...


# Chapter 20


Five figures wandered slowly over the blighted land. Bits of it were dullish grey, bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it rather less interesting to look at.

With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat.

In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that hadn't lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot.

Marvin started his ironical humming again.

With little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down the incline into the crater, trying very hard not to look at its unfortunate creator.

"Life," said Marvin dolefully, "loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it."

Arthur stamped around in a huff, and then decided that a whale's graveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in.

Marvin eyed him balefully for a moment, and then turned himself off.

Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground, though it was less thoroughly squalid.

"I only know as much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions. And its current conditions are not good."

"They showed up nothing. Nothing unexpected at least. They showed that I was clever, imaginative, irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn't have guessed."

Ford nodded.

"I'll tell you about it later," choked Zaphod as all three passed out.


# Chapter 21


On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily.

Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, walking treeoids and superintelligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms.

And it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biro­‐oriented stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life

The robot still sat there, completely inert.

He woke the robot up because even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody.

"I know," he said. "Wretched isn't it?"

"I've seen it," said Marvin. "It's rubbish."

"I know," said Marvin, "you keep going on about it. It sounds awful."

"Tell me," inquired Arthur, "do you get on well with other robots?"

"Don't blame you," said Marvin and counted five hundred and ninety­‐seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a second later.


# Chapter 22


The man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed.

"Fascinating trade," said the old man, and a wistful look came into his eyes, "doing the coastlines was always my favourite. Used to have endless fun doing the little bits in fjords..."

Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this.

"If you'd call it a robot," muttered Arthur. "It's more a sort of electronic sulking machine."

"Dent. Arthur Dent," said Arthur.

"Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent," said the old man, sternly. "It's a sort of threat you see." Another wistful look came into his tired old eyes. "I've never been very good at them myself, but I'm told they can be very effective."

Arthur blinked at him.

"We are going deep into the bowels of the planet where even now our race is being revived from its five­‐million­‐year slumber. Magrathea awakes."

"My name?" said the old man, and the same distant sadness came into his face again. He paused. "My name," he said, "... is Slartibartfast."


# Chapter 23


It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem.

The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double­‐backwards­‐somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the "Star Sprangled Banner", but in fact the message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish.


# Chapter 24


He closed his eyes in terror.

Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes.

"Earthman," he said, "we are now deep in the heart of Magrathea."

Arthur made nervous noises.

Slartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly. "It scares the willies out of me. Hold tight."

The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like.

"Welcome," said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, travelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into the mindboggling space, "welcome," he said, "to our factory floor."

Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror.

"No, we've been awakened to perform just one extraordinary commission for very... special clients from another dimension. It may interest you... there in the distance in front of us."

Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in that direction.

"Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact," said Slartibartfast cheerfully.

"Pity," said Slartibartfast, "that was one of mine. Won an award you know. Lovely crinkly edges."

"The mice were furious?"

"Look," said Arthur, "would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?"

"Earthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was destroyed five minutes before the completion of the purpose for which it was built, and we've got to build another one."

"Indeed Earthman."

"These creatures you call mice, you see, they are not quite as they appear. They are merely the protrusion into our dimension of vast hyperintelligent pan­‐dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese and the squeaking is just a front."

"You see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever hyperintelligent pan­‐dimensional beings. Your planet and people have formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten­‐million­‐year research programme..."

"Time," said Arthur weakly, "is not currently one of my problems."


# Chapter 25


On the day of the Great On­‐Turning two soberly dressed programmers with brief cases arrived and were shown discreetly into the office.

Their names were Lunkwill and Fook.

It said: "What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space have been called into existence?"

"I described myself as the second greatest," intoned Deep Thought, "and such I am."

"The Milliard Gargantubrain?" said Deep Thought with unconcealed contempt. "A mere abacus — mention it not."

"A five­‐week sand blizzard?" said Deep Thought haughtily. "You ask this of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang itself? Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff."

"The Great Hyperlobic Omni­‐Cognate Neutron Wrangler," said Deep Thought thoroughly rolling the r's, "could talk all four legs off an Arcturan MegaDonkey — but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards."

"I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons!" he boomed. "I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me!"

"I think this is getting needlessly messianic."

"O Deep Thought Computer," he said, "the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to tell us..." he paused, "... the Answer!"

"The answer?" said Deep Thought. "The answer to what?"

"Life!" urged Fook. "The Universe!" said Lunkwill. "Everything!" they said in chorus.

"Yes," said Deep Thought. "Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is an answer. But," he added, "I'll have to think about it."

"I am Majikthise!" announced the older one. "And I demand that I am Vroomfondel!" shouted the younger one.

"Alright!" bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk. "I am Vroomfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! What we demand is solid facts!"

Scarcely pausing for breath, Vroomfondel shouted, "We don't demand solid facts! What we demand is a total absence of solid facts. I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel!"

"We demand," yelled Vroomfondel, "that demarcation may or may not be the problem!"

"That's right!" shouted Vroomfondel, "we demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!"

"That's right!" agreed Majikthise. "You'll have a national Philosopher's strike on your hands!"

"Seven and a half million years," said Deep Thought.

"So long as you can keep disagreeing with each other violently enough and slagging each other off in the popular press, you can keep yourself on the gravy train for life. How does that sound?"


"Bloody hell," said Majikthise, "now that is what I call thinking. Here Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like that?"

# Chapter 27


Slartibartfast's study was a total mess, like the results of an explosion in a public library.

"Terribly unfortunate," he said, "a diode blew in one of the life­‐support computers. When we tried to revive our cleaning staff we discovered they'd been dead for nearly thirty thousand years. Who's going to clear away the bodies, that's what I want to know."

"Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest and Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known... The Time of Waiting is over!"

"Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this Great and Hopefully Enlightening Day!" cried the cheer leader. "The Day of the Answer!"

"For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little problems of Life, the Universe and Everything!"

"Seventy­‐five thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this program in motion," the second man said, "and in all that time we will be the first to hear the computer speak."

"Shhh," said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, "I think Deep Thought is preparing to speak!"

There was a moment's expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication channel.

"Good morning," said Deep Thought at last.

"Though I don't think," added Deep Thought, "that you're going to like it."

"You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought.

"Forty­‐two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.


# Chapter 28


"We're going to get lynched aren't we?" he whispered.

"Forty­‐two!" yelled Loonquawl. "Is that all you've got to show for seven and a half million years' work?"

"I checked it very thoroughly," said the computer, "and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is."

"Exactly!" said Deep Thought. "So once you do know what the question actually is, you'll know what the answer means."

"But I'll tell you who can," said Deep Thought.

"I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after me," intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones.

"A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate — and yet I will design it for you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix."

"And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten­‐million­‐year program! Yes! I shall design this computer for you. And I shall name it also unto you. And it shall be called... The Earth."

Phouchg gaped at Deep Thought.


# Chapter 29


"Zaphod! Wake up!"

"Mmmmmwwwwwerrrrr?"

"He got a double dose of the gas," said Trillian looking down at him, "two windpipes."

It was very yellow and very shiny, and when he breathed on it his breath evaporated off it in that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates off solid gold.

"Ah, shit," he said, "you wake me up from my own perfectly good dream to show me somebody else's."

"Very pretty," said Zaphod petulantly.

In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number. It said, Whatever your tastes, Magrathea can cater for you. We are not proud.

"I figure this," said Zaphod. "Whatever happened to my mind, I did it. And I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the government screening tests. And I wasn't to know anything about it myself. Pretty crazy, right?"

"What's all this?" said Trillian.

"That's it," said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls.

Zaphod shrugged.

"No," he said at last, "I don't seem to be letting myself into any of my secrets. Still," he added on further reflection, "I can understand that. I wouldn't trust myself further than I could spit a rat."

"The mice will see you now," he said.


# Chapter 30


"Deep Thought designed the Earth, we built it and you lived on it."

"And the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before the program was completed," added Arthur, not unbitterly.

"Well that's bureaucracy for you," he added.

"No," said the old man, "that's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the Universe has that."

"Maybe. Who cares?" said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited.

"Perhaps I'm old and tired," he continued, "but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied. Look at me: I design coastlines. I got an award for Norway."

"I've been doing fjords in all my life. For a fleeting moment they become fashionable and I get a major award."

"In this replacement Earth we're building they've given me Africa to do and of course I'm doing it with all fjords again because I happen to like them, and I'm old fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely baroque feel to a continent."

"Science has achieved some wonderful things of course, but I'd far rather be happy than right any day."

"It has already been hailed, so I gather, as the third most improbable event in the history of the Universe." "What were the first two?" "Oh, probably just coincidences," said Slartibartfast carelessly.

"I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," he muttered to himself.


# Chapter 31


It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated.

For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they came across — which happened to be the Earth — where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog.

"Arthur! You're safe!" a voice cried. "Am I?" said Arthur, rather startled. "Oh good."

"Well," said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, "our hosts here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being generally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to make it up to us."

A small voice said, "Welcome to lunch, Earth creature."

There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at Arthur.

Arthur gaped.

She looked him in the eye and Arthur thought he detected the tiniest resigned shrug.

"Could you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey?" she said.

Slartibartfast coughed politely.

"I'll just go and get on with some of my fjords then."

"Ah, well in fact that won't be necessary," said Frankie mouse. "It looks very much as if we won't be needing the new Earth any longer."

"Thank you Slartibartfast," said Benji firmly. "That will be all."

"Well, goodbye Earthman," he said to Arthur, "hope the lifestyle comes together."

"Now," said Benji mouse, "to business."

"And this is more or less the point — we're sick to the teeth with the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again on account of those whinnet­‐ridden Vogons quite frankly gives me the screaming heeby jeebies, you know what I mean?"

"Something that sounds good?" exclaimed Arthur. "An Ultimate Question that sounds good? From a couple of mice?"

The mice bristled.

"there comes a point I'm afraid where you begin to suspect that if there's any real truth, it's that the entire multi­‐dimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs."

"But..." started Arthur, hopelessly.

"In other words," said Benji, steering his curious little vehicle right over to Arthur, "there's a good chance that the structure of the question is encoded in the structure of your brain — so we want to buy it off you."

"No, no," said Frankie, "it's the brain we want to buy."

"Yeah," said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, "you'd just have to program it to say What? and I don't understand and Where's the tea? — who'd know the difference?"

With one more yank, Ford and Zaphod got the door open. On the other side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men who they could only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea. Not only were they ugly themselves, but the medical equipment they carried with them was also far from pretty."

So — Arthur was about to have his head cut open, Trillian was unable to help him, and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set upon by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than they were.

All in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every alarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting din.


# Chapter 32


"Damnation," muttered Frankie mouse, "all that fuss over two pounds of Earthling brain."

"The only thing we can do now," said Benji, crouching and stroking his whiskers in thought, "is to try and fake a question, invent one that will sound plausible."

Then Frankie said: "Here's a thought. How many roads must a man walk down?"

"Yes," he said, "that's excellent! Sounds very significant without actually tying you down to meaning anything at all. How many roads must a man walk down? Forty­‐two. Excellent, excellent, that'll fox 'em. Frankie baby, we are made!"

They performed a scampering dance in their excitement.

A voice on a loud hailer said, "OK Beeblebrox, hold it right there. We've got you covered."

"We don't want to shoot you, Beeblebrox!" shouted the figure. "Suits me fine!" shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap between two data process units.

"Hey, they're shooting at us," said Arthur, crouching in a tight ball, "I thought they said they didn't want to do that."

After a moment a voice replied, "It isn't easy being a cop!"

Ford shouted out, "Hey listen! I think we've got enough problems on our own having you shooting at us, so if you could avoid laying your problems on us as well, I think we'd all find it easier to cope!"

"Now see here, guy," said the voice on the loud hailer, "you're not dealing with any dumb two­‐bit trigger­‐pumping morons with low hairlines, little piggy eyes and no conversation, we're a couple of intelligent caring guys that you'd probably quite like if you met us socially!"

"I don't go around gratuitously shooting people and then bragging about it afterwards in seedy space­‐rangers bars, like some cops I could mention! I go around shooting people gratuitously and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend!"

"And I write novels!" chimed in the other cop. "Though I haven't had any of them published yet, so I better warn you, I'm in a meeeean mood!"

Ford's eyes popped halfway out of their sockets. "Who are these guys?" he said. "Dunno," said Zaphod, "I think I preferred it when they were shooting."

"We didn't enjoy doing that at all," shouted the other cop. "We could tell," shouted Ford.

"Now either you all give yourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course because we are firmly opposed to needless violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possibly one or two others we noticed on our way out here!"

"Because there are some things you have to do even if you are an enlightened liberal cop who knows all about sensitivity and everything!"

The heat and noise was quite fantastic. Slowly, the computer bank was beginning to disintegrate. The front had almost all melted away, and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding their way back towards where they were squatting. They huddled further back and waited for the end.


# Chapter 33


But the end never came, at least not then.

"Right," said Ford, "I'm going to have a look." He glanced round at the others. "Is no one going to say, No you can't possibly, let me go instead?" They all shook their heads.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. 

This struck Ford as being extremely odd.

"Let's get shot out of this hole," said Zaphod. "If whatever I'm supposed to be looking for is here, I don't want it." He grabbed the second Kill­‐O­‐Zap gun, blasted a perfectly harmless accounting computer and rushed out into the corridor, followed by the others.


# Chapter 34


R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more than say five minutes late.

R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast.

In his experience the Universe simply didn't work like that.

"Don't feel you have to take any notice of me, please," came a muffled drone.

"But how are you, metalman?" said Ford. "Very depressed."

"What's up?" "I don't know," said Marvin, "I've never been there."

"It's a very effective way of being wretched," said Marvin. "Don't pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me."

"I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it," said Marvin. "And what happened?" pressed Ford. "It committed suicide," said Marvin


# Chapter 35


That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light years between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the small palm tree on the bridge trying to bang his brain into shape with massive Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters

"The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases."

"OK baby, hold tight," said Zaphod. "We'll take in a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."



##########################################



## THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE


There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.


# Chapter 1


In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.

Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure.

The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call The Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.

And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet — especially by the strange ape­‐like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program.

Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he had hitherto claimed; and, more to the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying saucers.

And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship is moving slowly towards them.


# Chapter 2


Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not by reliable witnesses.

In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you would have to go inside and look at a Vogon.

If you are wise, however, this is precisely what you will avoid doing because the average Vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish you had never been born — or (if you are a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never been born.

Anatomical analysis of the Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver.

This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, and he was it who had had the job of demolishing the so­‐called "planet" Earth.

Aesthetics and technology were closed books to him and, had he had his way, burnt and buried books as well.

It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and this was certainly true in his case. 

When he heard the words "integrity" or "moral rectitude", he reached for his dictionary, and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he reached for the rule book and threw it away.

"Computer," he croaked, "get me my brain care specialist on the line."

"Well," he said, "hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and how are we feeling today?"

"Well," he said, "I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a Vogon, you know? The natural and healthy channelling of the aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence."

For an instant Halfrunt's smile flickered.

"Ah, no," said Halfrunt, "in my profession you know, we do not make personal friends." "Ah," grunted the Vogon, "professional detachment." "No," said Halfrunt cheerfully, "we just don't have the knack."

"But Beeblebrox, you know," he said, "he is one of my most profitable clients. He had personality problems beyond the dreams of analysts."

"Well," said Halfrunt brightly, "Zaphod's just this guy, you know?"

The Vogon Captain pressed a communicator button which connected him with the remains of his crew. "Attack," he said.

The Heart of Gold's Improbability Drive made it the most powerful and unpredictable ship in existence. There was nothing it couldn't do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen.

"Starpox!" he shouted.

Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin in search of a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon with a great deal of optimism

"Share and Enjoy," the machine replied and provided him with yet another cup of the sickly liquid.

The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local language, to read "Go stick your head in a pig", and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration.

"Ah," said Arthur, "so I'm a masochist on diet am I?"

"You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?" "Er, yes. With milk."


# Chapter 3


"Does anyone have a kettle?" Arthur asked as he walked on to the bridge

"Hey, didja hear that?" muttered Zaphod as he leapt now for the manual controls of the Infinite Improbability Drive, "the monkey spoke!"

Arthur gibbered.

He started to speak, and stopped. He started to speak again and stopped again. Finally he managed to speak. "Er," he said.

"What have you done to it, Monkeyman?" he breathed.

As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to start firing.

"Dying for a cup of tea, eh?" he said.

Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on.

Outside, the thunderous roar of the Definit­‐Kil cannon continued to rip at the force­‐field.

"Yeah. Listen, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third..." "What?" "There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine.

The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a far corner where Marvin the Paranoid Android sat slumped, ignoring all and ignored by all, in a private and rather unpleasant world of his own.

"Ah," he snapped. "Zaphod Beeblebrox. The last of our great line. Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth."

"We've been following your progress with considerable despondency..."

Zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and wondered if he shouldn't just jump over and have done with it.

"But I was President of the Galaxy, man!"

Ford nodded despondently.

"It is trying," said Zaphod with wonderful restraint, "to make tea."

"Oh, and Zaphod?" "Er, yeah?" "If you ever find you need help again, you know, if you're in trouble, need a hand out of a tight corner..." "Yeah?" "Please don't hesitate to get lost."


# Chapter 4


On the delivery plate of the Nutri­‐Matic Drink Synthesizer was a small tray, on which sat three bone china cups and saucers, a bone china jug of milk, a silver teapot full of the best tea Arthur had ever tasted, and a small printed note saying "Wait".


# Chapter 5


Ursa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in the known Universe.

It is a West Zone planet which by an inexplicable and somewhat suspicious freak of topography consists almost entirely of sub­‐tropical coastline. By an equally suspicious freak of temporal relastatics, it is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before the beach bars close.

Most particularly it shines on a building, a tall beautiful building consisting of two thirty­‐storey white towers connected by a bridge half­‐way up their length.

It is of course that invaluable companion for all those who want to see the marvels of the known Universe for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day — The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

If you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard you would enter the Lalamatine district of shops, bolonut trees and pavement cafes where the UM­‐Betans come to relax after a hard afternoon's relaxation on the beach.

He fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses.

They were a double pair of Joo Janta 200 Super­‐Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which had been specially designed to help people develop a relaxed attitude to danger. At the first hint of trouble they turn totally black and thus prevent you from seeing anything that might alarm you.

"Worst thing that ever happened to the Guide, moving to Ursa Minor Beta," he grumbled, "they've all gone soft."

He sat still and ignored the thought furiously. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He gave in to it. What the hell, he thought, go with the flow.


# Chapter 6


"Hello? Yes? Megadodo Publications, home of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the most totally remarkable book in the whole of the known Universe, can I help you?"

It adored working for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it just wished there was some way of keeping all the hitch­‐hikers away. Weren't they meant to be hanging round dirty spaceports or something?

"Yes, I passed on your message to Mr. Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now."

"The Guide is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate."

they claimed that the first version of the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing, summoned a qualified poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth, truth beauty and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party was Life itself for failing to be either beautiful or true.

"Look," said Zaphod, "I'm up to here with cool, OK? I'm so amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat inside me for a month. I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis."

"This cat's on an intergalactic cruise... in his office?" 

"Listen, three eyes," he said, "don't you try to outweird me. I get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal."

Zaphod leaned forward, conspirationally.

"Mr. Beeblebrox, sir," said the insect in awed wonder, "you're so weird you should be in movies."

"Yes, sir," it snapped, "can I help you?" "I doubt it," said Marvin.

"No one can help me," intoned Marvin.

"Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal..."

With a grinding of gears Marvin turned and trundled off. 

"One moment I was sitting in your ship feeling very depressed, and the next moment I was standing here feeling utterly miserable."

"Oh, fine," said Marvin, "if you happen to like being me which personally I don't."

"May I ask you," inquired the elevator in its sweetest, most reasonable voice, "if you've considered all the possibilities that down might offer you?"

Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall. He didn't need this, he thought to himself, this of all things he had no need of.

Most of all he didn't want to be standing in an office block arguing with an elevator.

"Holy Zarquon," muttered Zaphod, "did I ask for an existentialist elevator?" 

"Afraid?" cried Zaphod, "Of what? Heights? An elevator that's afraid of heights?"

Modern elevators are strange and complex entities.

An impoverished hitch­‐hiker visiting any planets in the Sirius star system these days can pick up easy money working as a counsellor for neurotic elevators.

"Left in the lurch by a lift," muttered Zaphod, who was feeling at his least jaunty.

"I'm dead certain this building shouldn't be shaking," Zaphod said.

He walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because at that moment his Joo Janta 200 Super­‐Chromatic Peril Sensitive sunglasses had turned utterly black.

"Who in the Galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company?"

"Beeblebrox, over here!" he shouted. Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the building. "No," called Zaphod, "Beeblebrox over here!"

"Do you know," Zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived, "your building's being bombed?" The man indicated his awareness.

"Frogstar Fighters!" muttered Zaphod, "Zarquon!"


# Chapter 7


"Let me introduce myself," the man said, "My name is Roosta, and this is my towel."

"And me," said Marvin in a soft low voice, "with this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side."

"How do you think I feel?" said Marvin bitterly.

"What a depressingly stupid machine," said Marvin and trudged away.


# Chapter 8


"So, do we just sit here, or what?" said Zaphod angrily, "what do these guys out here want?" "You, Beeblebrox," said Roosta, "they're going to take you to the Frogstar — the most totally evil world in the Galaxy."

"They're taking the building," said Roosta, "we're airborne."

"If I ever meet myself," said Zaphod, "I'll hit myself so hard I won't know what's hit me."

Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod accusingly, slumped in a corner and switched himself off.

The left­‐hand tower of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices streaked through interstellar space at a speed never equalled either before or since by any other office block in the Universe.

"The yellow stripes are high in protein, the green ones have vitamin B and C complexes, the little pink flowers contain wheatgerm extracts."

"They're going to feed you," said Roosta, "into the Total Perspective Vortex!"

"Listen!" said Roosta urgently, "you can kill a man, destroy his body, break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can annihilate a man's soul! The treatment lasts seconds, but the effect lasts the rest of your life!"

"Phreeow!" admitted Zaphod, much impressed.


# Chapter 9


The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale and unwholesome.

This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the reputation of being the most totally evil place in the Galaxy. From without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet across. From within it was something more monstrous than the mind can comprehend.

"The building will shortly be landing. When you leave the building, do not go out of the door," said Roosta, "go out of the window."

They never landed on Frogstar World B. No one did. No one ever walked on its surface other than the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex.

As he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs, his eyes smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin.

"Hey, er..." he stammered.

"I am Gargravarr. I am the Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex."

Zaphod nodded. He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses again.

"I am here," said the voice slowly, "my body wanted to come but it's a bit busy at the moment. Things to do, people to see." After what seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh it added, "You know how it is with bodies."

"I'll hum for you," said Gargravarr, "follow the humming."


# Chapter 10


The Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big place, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend to ignore.

For when you are put into the Vortex you are given just one momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of creation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot, which says "You are here."

"Hey, what was that?" he muttered voicelessly. "A recording," said Gargravarr, "of the last man who was put in the Vortex. It is always played to the next victim. A sort of prelude."

"couldn't we maybe slope off to a party or something for a while, think it over?" "For all I know," said Gargravarr's ethereal voice, "I'm probably at one. My body that is. It goes to a lot of parties without me. Says I only get in the way. Hey ho."

"I think we are probably not very well suited," said Gargravarr again at length, "we never seemed to be happy doing the same things. We always had the greatest arguments over sex and fishing. Eventually we tried to combine the two, but that only led to disaster, as you can probably imagine."

"Pizpot," said the voice, "My name is Pizpot Gargravarr. Says it all really doesn't it?"

"Errr..." said Zaphod sympathetically.

At that moment another dismal scream rent the air and Zaphod shuddered.

"The Universe," said Gargravarr simply, "the whole infinite Universe. The infinite suns, the infinite distances between them, and yourself an invisible dot on an invisible dot, infinitely small."

After five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was there in the box with him.


# Chapter 11


The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses.

it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation — every sun, every planet, their orbits, their composition and their economic and social history from, say, one small piece of fairy cake.

The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so basically in order to annoy his wife.

Trin Tragula — for that was his name — was a dreamer, a thinker, a speculative philosopher or, as his wife would have it, an idiot.

To Trin Tragula's horror, the shock completely annihilated her brain; but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion.

Zaphod shrugged smugly. "It just told me what I knew all the time. I'm a really terrific and great guy. Didn't I tell you, baby, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox!"

The elation of his recent experience was still with him though. The whole Universe. He had seen the whole Universe stretching to infinity around him — everything. And with it had come the clear and extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it.

Having a conceited ego is one thing. Actually being told by a machine is another.

"Nine hundred years..." he breathed to himself. That was how late the ship was.

"The statistical likelihood," continued the autopilot primly, "is that other civilizations will arise. There will one day be lemon­‐soaked paper napkins. Till then there will be a short delay. Please return to your seat."

Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered. His mouths said foolish things. He dropped into a chair.

Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled.

He smiled the smile that Zaphod had wanted to hit and this time Zaphod hit it.

"hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me you don't even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am."

"I know how you feel," said Zaphod, "I'm so great even I get tongue­‐tied talking to myself."

A green blur watched them disapprovingly. It coughed. "Good evening, madam, gentlemen," it said, "do you have a reservation?"

In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows disdainfully, this is what the green blur now did.

Arthur Dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath.

"... and the Universe," concluded the waiter, determined not to be deflected on his home stretch, "will explode later for your pleasure."

In an extraordinary gesture which is pointless attempting to describe, Zaphod Beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two of his arms and one of his thighs with the other.

"Yes sir," said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel, "this is Milliways — the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."

Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over to the bar and bought most of it.

One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broadminded and well­‐adjusted family can't cope with.

Most readers get as far as the Future Semi­‐Conditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up: and in fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.

This, even if the rest were true, which it isn't, is patently impossible, say the doubters.

All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in your own era, and when you arrive at the End of Time the operation of compound interest means that the fabulous cost of your meal has been paid for.

This, many claim, is not merely impossible but clearly insane

"If you've done six impossible things this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe?"


# Chapter 16


At the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt. His heads knocked together and his smiles were coming out of synch. He was miserably happy.

"Listen Ford," said Zaphod, "everything's cool and froody."

Zaphod giggled into his drink. It frothed up over the side of the glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top.

A wild­‐skinned sky­‐gypsy approached them and played electric violin at them until Zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed to go away again.

"Wowee," said Zaphod, "Zappo."

"At the End of the Universe you have to use the past tense a lot," said Zaphod

"Zowee," said Zaphod, "here we are at the End of the Universe and you haven't even lived yet. Did you miss out."

"That really huge number," he continued, "how does it go? 'Bwarm! Bwarm! Baderr!!' something, and in the stage act you do it ends up with this ship crashing right into the sun, and you actually do it!"

"Ship! Sun! Wham bang!" he cried. "I mean forget lasers and stuff, you guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and terrible songs."

"I am Mr. Desiato's bodyguard," it went, "and I am responsible for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away before it gets damaged."


# Chapter 17


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all.

Regular concert goers judge that the best sound balance is usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty­‐seven miles from the stage

whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments by remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the planet — or more frequently around a completely different planet.

Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the familiar theme of boy­‐being meets girl­‐being beneath a silvery moon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason.

Many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for artistic reasons, but most commonly because the band's public address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations treaties.

appointed Professor of Neomathematics at the University of Maximegalon, in recognition of both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax Returns, in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space­‐time continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent.

Ford waggled his head noncommittally.

"He's spending a year dead for tax reasons."

"Would you like to see the menu?" he said, "or would you like to meet the Dish of the Day?" "Huh?" said Ford. "Huh?" said Arthur. "Huh?" said Trillian. "That's cool," said Zaphod, "we'll meet the meat."

In a small room in one of the arms of the Restaurant complex a tall, thin, gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion looked him in the face.

He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on his features went off to play somewhere more healthy. 

"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "The Universe as we know it has now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour. So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe!"

"I've just come straight from the very very other end of time, where I've been hosting a show at the Big Bang Burger Bar — where I can tell you we had a very exciting evening ladies and gentlemen — and I will be with you right through this historic occasion, the End of History itself!"

"ladies and gentlemen," he breathed, "the candles are lit, the band plays softly, and as the force­‐shielded dome above us fades into transparency, revealing a dark and sullen sky hung heavy with the ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see we're all in for a fabulous evening's apocalypse!"

"For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the end of the tunnel," he said, "this is it." The band struck up again.

A large dairy animal approached Zaphod Beeblebrox's table, a large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips.

"Good evening," it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, "I am the main Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my body?"

It harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at them.

Its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger from Zaphod Beeblebrox.

"That's not the point," Arthur protested. Then he thought about it for a moment. "Alright," he said, "maybe it is the point. I don't care, I'm not going to think about it now. I'll just... er..."

The Universe raged about him in its death throes.

"A green salad," said Arthur emphatically.

"A green salad?" said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly at Arthur.

"A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good," it said, "I'll just nip off and shoot myself." He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur. "Don't worry, sir," he said, "I'll be very humane."

"Hey, Earthman," said Zaphod with a malicious grin on the face that wasn't stuffing itself, "what's eating you?"

For an infinite number of miles in every direction the universal cataclysm was gathering to a stupefying climax.

"And now, ladies and gentlemen," he beamed, "is everyone having one last wonderful time?" "Yes," called out the sort of people who call out "yes" when comedians ask them if they're having a wonderful time.

"And as the photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing to tear apart the last of the red hot suns, I know you're all going to settle back and enjoy with me what I know we will find all an immensely exciting and terminal experience."

"Believe me, ladies and gentlemen," he said, "there's nothing penultimate about this one."

"This," he said, "really is the absolute end, the final chilling desolation, in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes extinct. This ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial 'it'."

"And for once," he cried cheerily, "you don't need to worry about having a hangover in the morning — because there won't be any more mornings!"

"And finally," said Max, quieting the audience down and putting on his solemn face, "finally I believe we have with us here tonight, a party of believers, very devout believers, from the Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon."

The party of Zarquon's followers sat rigid, refusing to be buffeted by the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over them.

Ford gave him a three­‐Pan­‐Galactic­‐Gargle­‐Blaster look, in other words a rather unsteady one.

"I see." "You don't see. You don't see at all. I haven't got to the clever bit yet. You want to hear the clever bit?" "Tell me the clever bit." "I'll tell you the clever bit." Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit was.

One of his minds raced. The other dawdled lovingly over the food it was still shovelling in.

"I am not," said the waiter, "personally acquainted with the metal gentlemen in question, sir..."

"But I am informed that he has been awaiting your return for a considerable number of millennia."

"Left here?" said Zaphod, "are you being strange? We only just arrived here." "Indeed, sir," persisted the waiter doggedly, "but before you arrived here, sir, I understand that you left here."

"Put your analyst on danger money, baby," advised Zaphod.

"Listen you semi­‐evolved simian," cut in Zaphod, "go climb a tree will you?"

"Go bang your heads together four­‐eyes," he advised Zaphod.

"No, no," the waiter said to Zaphod, "your monkey has got it right, sir."

Arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing apposite, or indeed coherent.

"You jumped forward... I believe five hundred and seventy­‐six thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place," explained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling that he had finally won through against what had seemed to be insuperable odds.

They all agreed this was very neat.

"Whatever happened to Marvin?" said Trillian.

"Shee, you guys are so unhip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off."

"Hey, Marvin, is that you?" said Zaphod into the phone, "How you doing, kid?" There was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line. "I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said.

"Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to..."

"Yeah, yeah," sympathized Zaphod hardly at all.

"I can even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water? I've got one ready. Wait a minute."

"What's he saying?" asked Trillian. "Nothing," said Zaphod, "he just phoned up to wash his head at us."

In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw down the phone and wrote "Hotblack Desiato" on the bill.

"But what about the End of the Universe? We'll miss the big moment." "I've seen it. It's rubbish," said Zaphod, "nothing but a gnab gib." "A what?" "Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let's get zappy."

"Well," said Max beaming cheerfully at them, "it's too late to worry about whether you left the gas on now."

# Chapter 18


A Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter took them down deep into the substrata beneath the Restaurant. They were glad to see it had been vandalized and didn't try to make them happy as well as take them down.

The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete wall with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for all of fifty major lifeforms. Nevertheless, like every car park in the Galaxy throughout the entire history of car parks, this car park smelt predominantly of impatience

"Suit yourself," said Zaphod and turned away to ogle the ships.

"Five hundred and seventy­‐six thousand million, three thousand five hundred and seventy­‐nine years," said Marvin, "I counted them."

"The first ten million years were the worst," said Marvin, "and the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of decline."

"You don't like talking to me do you?" said Marvin in a low desolate tone. Trillian talked to Arthur instead.

"Zaphod," he said in a quiet voice, "just look at some of these little star trolleys..."

Zaphod whistled appreciatively.

"Amazing looking ship though. Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow."

Zaphod's attention however was elsewhere. His attention was riveted on the ship standing next to Hotblack Desiato's limo. His mouths hung open.

"It's so... black!" said Ford Prefect, "you can hardly make out its shape... light just seems to fall into it!"

Zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a man possessed — or more accurately like a man who wanted to possess.

"it's just totally frictionless. This must be one mother of a mover..."

"You mean... er..." Ford looked over his shoulder. "You mean stroll off with it? You think we should?" "No." "Nor do I." "But we're going to, aren't we?" "How can we not?"

Slowly, laboriously, and with a million little clanking and creaking noises that he had learned to simulate, Marvin turned round to answer the summons.

"Sounds awful," Marvin said.

"Well I wish you'd just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm," said Marvin, "because I haven't got one."

"Don't mention it," said Marvin, "Oh, you didn't." He trudged away again.

In the Restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment after which there wouldn't be any more moments.

All eyes were fixed on the dome, other than those of Hotblack Desiato's bodyguard, which were looking intently at Hotblack Desiato, and those of Hotblack Desiato himself which the bodyguard had closed out of respect.

His bodyguard was not a man which improved with proximity. 

Hotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing.

"The skies begin to boil!" he cried. "Nature collapses into the screaming void! In twenty seconds' time, the Universe itself will be at an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!"

At the back of the Restaurant the stony­‐faced party from the Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying.

Zarquon coughed. He peered round at the assembled gathering. The stars in his eyes blinked uneasily. He handled the microphone with confusion. "Er..." he said, "hello. Er, look, I'm sorry I'm a bit late. I've had the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment."

He seemed nervous of the expectant awed hush. He cleared his throat. "Er, how are we for time?" he said, "have I just got a min — " And so the Universe ended.


# Chapter 19


One of the major selling point of that wholly remarkable travel book, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, apart from its relative cheapness and the fact that it has the words DON'T PANIC written in large friendly letters on its cover, is its compendious and occasionally accurate glossary.

However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero.

From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.
