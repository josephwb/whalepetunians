## THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY


# Preface


Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.

Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety­‐two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape­‐descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.

This planet has — or rather had — a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.

Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.

And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.

Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.

Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.

But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply. It begins with a house.


# Chapter 1


Not a remarkable house by any means — it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye.

The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about.

It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock down his house and build an bypass instead.

At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very good.

He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash.

Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn.

The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with.

"Yellow," he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed.

Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path.

the only vestiges left in Mr. L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats.

Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.

"What do you mean, why's it got to be built?" he said. "It's a bypass. You've got to build bypasses."

"Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard."

"Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?"

By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape­‐descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually claimed.

Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.

He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but a harmless one — an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance he would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun of any astrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out.

Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing.

Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn't matter that much really.

Thereafter, staggering semi­‐paralytic down the night streets he would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse.

"I'm trying to baby, I'm trying to," is what Ford invariably replied on these occasions.

Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth.

He knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan dollars a day.

The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in.

"What?" said Arthur Dent.

"Look, don't you understand?" shouted Arthur. He pointed at Prosser. "That man wants to knock my house down!"

Ford glanced at him, puzzled.

"Oh don't give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No, don't you give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ For my head will fly, my tongue will lie, my eyes will fry and I may die/ Won't you pour me one more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit"

Ford Prefect usually played to lose.

"In, as you say it, the mud."

As soon as Mr. Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it. He sighed.

"And no sneaky knocking down Mr. Dent's house whilst he's away, alright?" he said.

"The mere thought," growled Mr. Prosser, "hadn't even begun to speculate," he continued, settling himself back, "about the merest possibility of crossing my mind."

Arthur remained very worried.


# Chapter 2


the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.

Drink... but... very carefully...

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than the Encyclopedia Galactica.

"Six pints of bitter," said Ford Prefect to the barman of the Horse and Groom. "And quickly please, the world's about to end."

"No, no," said Ford, "it's just that the world's about to end."

"Ford," said Arthur, "would you please tell me what the hell is going on?"

"Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so."

"Did I do anything wrong today," he said, "or has the world always been like this and I've been too wrapped up in myself to notice?"

Arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile. The rest of the pub frowned at him. A man waved at him to stop smiling at them and mind his own business.

"This must be Thursday," said Arthur musing to himself, sinking low over his beer, "I never could get the hang of Thursdays."


# Chapter 3


On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds.

It looked insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words DON'T PANIC printed on it in large friendly letters. 

A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have.

the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you — daft as a bush, but very ravenous)

"Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who really knows where his towel is." (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.)

"You got a towel with you?" said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur.

Ford clicked his tongue in irritation.

"It's probably just your house being knocked down," said Ford, drowning his last pint.

The barman cleared his throat. He heard himself say: "Last orders, please."

"What the hell's that?" he shrieked.

Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn't it just have to be the Vogons.

He knew where his towel was.

And still nothing happened.

"People of Earth, your attention please," a voice said, and it was wonderful. Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep.

Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth.

"What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? For heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout.

The Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry void.


# Chapter 4


It was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy. Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox? Not the President?

Many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas.

Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex­‐hippy, good timer, (crook? quite possibly), manic self­‐publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch.

Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it.

He was roughly humanoid in appearance except for the extra head and third arm. 

Zaphod smiled, picturing himself.

The President of the Galaxy had arrived.

The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it.

"That is really amazing," he said. "That really is truly amazing. That is so amazingly amazing I think I'd like to steal it."


# Chapter 5


Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was thoroughly vile. Also, he did not like hitchhikers.

"Whhhrrrr..." said Arthur Dent.

"How do you feel?" he asked. "Like a military academy," said Arthur, "bits of me keep on passing out."

"We hitched a lift," said Ford.

"Good grief," said Arthur, "is this really the interior of a flying saucer?"

"I like the cover," he said. "Don't Panic. It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day."

"On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you."

"Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I intended," said Ford. "I came for a week and got stuck for fifteen years."

"Look," said Arthur, "I'm a bit upset about that."

"You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxy's a fun place. You'll need to have this fish in your ear."


# Chapter 6


"Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh should have a good time."

"I worked hard to get where I am today, and I didn't become captain of a Vogon constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxi service for a load of degenerate freeloaders."

"Charming man," he said. "I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one..."

"They've got as much sex appeal as a road accident."

"What's so unpleasant about being drunk?" "You ask a glass of water."

'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanished in a puff of logic.

"Ford!"

"And what does it say now?" asked Arthur. "Mostly harmless," admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed cough.

"Well," said Ford, "if we're lucky it's just the Vogons come to throw us in to space."

"If we're unlucky," said Ford grimly, "the captain might be serious in his threat that he's going to read us some of his poetry first..."


# Chapter 7


Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe.

The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England in the destruction of the planet Earth.

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence of muscle movements.

The prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation Chairs — strapped in.

The Vogon began to read — a fetid little passage of his own devising.

"Nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh!" cried Ford Prefect

"I present you with a simple choice! Either die in the vacuum of space, or..." he paused for melodramatic effect, "tell me how good you thought my poem was!"

"So what you're saying is that I write poetry because underneath my mean callous heartless exterior I really just want to be loved," he said. He paused. "Is that right?"

"I just write poetry to throw my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief."

Arthur stared round him wildly.

"Death's too good for them," he said.

"My God," complained Arthur, "you're talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished today."

"Who said anything about panicking?" snapped Arthur. "This is still just the culture shock. You wait till I've settled down into the situation and found my bearings. Then I'll start panicking."

"Resistance is useless!"

"Eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..." said the guard

"No, I think if it's all the same to you," he said, "I'd better get you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other bits of shouting I've got to do."

"Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn..." said Arthur without any clear inflection.

"You see if I keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior Shouting Officer, and there aren't usually many vacancies for non­‐shouting and non­‐pushing­‐people­‐about officers, so I think I'd better stick to what I know."

"Da da da dum! Doesn't that stir anything in you?"


# Chapter 8


"Space," it says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen..." and so on.

However it goes on to say that what with space being the mind boggling size it is the chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to the power of two hundred and sixty­‐seven thousand seven hundred and nine to one against.


# Chapter 9


A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a nothingth of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of million light years from end to end.

On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like half­‐spent fish.

"Well, perhaps we're both going mad."

"Two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling"

"Haaaauuurrgghhh..." said Arthur as he felt his body softening and bending in unusual directions. 

"Ford," he said, "you're turning into a penguin. Stop it."

"Welcome," the voice said, "to the Starship Heart of Gold."

"Ford!" he said, "there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out."


# Chapter 10


The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace.

Many respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand for this — partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.

It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute's Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they really couldn't stand was a smartass.


# Chapter 11


In one corner a robot sat humped, its gleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel knees.

"Five to one against and falling..." she said, "four to one against and falling... three to one... two... one... probability factor of one to one... we have normality, I repeat we have normality."

"Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem."

"Just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space," she said. "Section ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha."

"OK, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, yeah?"

Trillian had come to suspect that the main reason why he had had such a wild and successful life was that he never really understood the significance of anything he did.

"But that's incredible." "No Zaphod. Just very very improbable."

"Er, yeah."

In the corner, the robot's head swung up sharply, but then wobbled about imperceptibly. It pulled itself up to its feet as if it was about five pounds heavier that it actually was, and made what an outside observer would have thought was a heroic effort to cross the room.

"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said. Its voice was low and hopeless.

"Oh God," muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seat.

With a microsecond pause, and a finely calculated micromodulation of pitch and timbre — nothing you could actually take offence at — Marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all things human.

"I won't enjoy it," said Marvin.

"I'm not getting you down at all am I?" he said pathetically.

"Life," said Marvin, "don't talk to me about life."

"I don't think I can stand that robot much longer Zaphod," growled Trillian.

The Encyclopaedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus designed to do the work of a man. The marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as "Your Plastic Pal Who's Fun To Be With."

"Oh," said Arthur, "sounds ghastly."

"Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah!" it said.

"Come on," he droned, "I've been ordered to take you down to the bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't."

"You watch this door," he muttered, "it's about to open again. I can tell by the intolerable air of smugness it suddenly generates."

"Zaphod Beeblebrox...?" he said weakly.

"Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed. Here's another of those self­‐satisfied door. Life! Don't talk to me about life."

Ford stared at him. "Did that robot say Zaphod Beeblebrox?" he said.


# Chapter 12


"And the question everyone's asking is... has the big Z finally flipped?"

"Well, Zaphod's jist zis guy you know?"

"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now."

He prefered people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous. 

"Oh God," said Zaphod. He hadn't worked with this computer for long but had already learned to loathe it.

Trillian punched up the figures. They showed two­‐to­‐the power­‐of­‐Infinity­‐minus­‐one (an irrational number that only has a conventional meaning in Improbability physics).

"I don't know," said Trillian, "but those aliens — they're on the way up to the bridge with that wretched robot. Can we pick them up on any monitor cameras?"


# Chapter 13


Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning.

"... and then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left hand side..."

"Well well well," he kept saying to himself, "Zaphod Beeblebrox..."

"I was told to take you to the bridge. Probably the highest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities today I shouldn't wonder."

"Thank you," it said, "for making a simple door very happy."

Deep in Marvin's thorax gears ground.

"Funny," he intoned funerally, "how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does."

"Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I'm standing?"

Ford was not going to be outcooled.

"Zaphod," he drawled, "great to see you, you're looking well, the extra arm suits you. Nice ship you've stolen."

"Oh sure," said Zaphod, "hi Arthur, glad you could make it." His right­‐hand head looked round casually, said "hi" and went back to having his teeth picked.

"What do you mean you've met?" he demanded. "This is Zaphod Beeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you know, not bloody Martin Smith from Croydon."

"We've met, haven't we Zaphod Beeblebrox — or should I say... Phil?"

"Hey doll, is this guy boring you? Why don't you talk to me instead? I'm from a different planet."

"Yes," said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel foolish. "He only had the two arms and the one head and he called himself Phil, but..."

"Tricia McMillian?" he said. "What are you doing here?"

"Trillian," he said, "is this sort of thing going to happen every time we use the Improbability drive?" "Very probably, I'm afraid," she said.


# Chapter 14


crew of four were ill at ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious principle of physics — as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and molecules

Ford couldn't sleep. He was too excited about being back on the road again.

He attacked everything in life with a mixture of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often difficult to tell which was which.

Arthur slept: he was terribly tired.

"There's a planet out there. It's at the exact coordinates you predicted."

Zaphod laughed. He was clearly very excited about something, almost childishly so.

"That..." said Zaphod, "is the most improbable planet that ever existed."


# Chapter 15


Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax free.

And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before — and thus was the Empire forged.

Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor — at least no one worth speaking of.

And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of specialist industry: custom­‐made luxury planet building.

The home of this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into dream planets — gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber planets with lots of earthquakes

In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of it.


# Chapter 16


"Magrathea is a myth, a fairy story, it's what parents tell their kids about at night if they want them to grow up to become economists, it's..."

"Hi there! This is Eddie your shipboard computer, and I'm feeling just great guys, and I know I'm just going to get a bundle of kicks out of any programme you care to run through me."

"I can even work out you personality problems to ten decimal places if it will help."

Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important.

"Is there any tea on this spaceship?" he asked.

Clearly, it was very very old.

One of Zaphod's heads looked away. The other one looked round to see what the first was looking at, but it wasn't looking at anything very much.

"You know I don't like the look of that planet at all," said Trillian shivering.

"I think it's just a dead planet," he said.

Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of the Galaxy


# Chapter 17


He had found a Nutri­‐Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.

It suddenly occurred to him to ask a question which had been bothering him. "Is it safe?" he said.

"Magrathea's been dead for five million years," said Zaphod, "of course it's safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now."

At which point a strange and inexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge — a noise as of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound. It preceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and insubstantial. The voice said "Greetings to you..."

"What the photon is it?"

"Just keep cool," said Zaphod.

"impact minus forty­‐five seconds. Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax."

The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they thundered towards the ship.

"This is it," said Arthur watching them. "We are now quite definitely going to die aren't we?"


# Chapter 18


Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, "What the hell happened?"

"They would appear," said Ford doubtfully, "to have turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale..."

Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet.

Ooooh, it's getting quite strong. And hey, what's about this whistling roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that... wind!

Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy with anticipation... Or is it the wind? There really is a lot of that now isn't it?

And wow! Hey! What's this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast? Very very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like... ow... ound... round... ground! That's it! That's a good name — ground! I wonder if it will be friends with me?

And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence.

Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now.


# Chapter 19


"Are we taking this robot with us?" said Ford, looking with distaste at Marvin who was standing in an awkward hunched posture in the corner under a small palm tree.

"But what are supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?"

"You think you've got problems," said Marvin

"It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level."

"My white mice have escaped!" she said.

An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of Zaphod's faces.

It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater attention had it been generally realized that human beings were only the third most intelligent life form present on the planet Earth, instead of (as was generally thought by most independent observers) the second.

Ford carried on counting quietly. This is about the most aggressive thing you can do to a computer, the equivalent of going up to a human being and saying Blood... blood... blood... blood...


# Chapter 20


Five figures wandered slowly over the blighted land. Bits of it were dullish grey, bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it rather less interesting to look at.

With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat.

In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that hadn't lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot.

Marvin started his ironical humming again.

With little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down the incline into the crater, trying very hard not to look at its unfortunate creator.

"Life," said Marvin dolefully, "loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it."

Arthur stamped around in a huff, and then decided that a whale's graveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in.

Marvin eyed him balefully for a moment, and then turned himself off.

Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground, though it was less thoroughly squalid.

"I only know as much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions. And its current conditions are not good."

"They showed up nothing. Nothing unexpected at least. They showed that I was clever, imaginative, irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn't have guessed."

Ford nodded.

"I'll tell you about it later," choked Zaphod as all three passed out.


# Chapter 21


On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily.

Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, walking treeoids and superintelligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms.

And it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biro­‐oriented stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life

The robot still sat there, completely inert.

He woke the robot up because even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody.

"I know," he said. "Wretched isn't it?"

"I've seen it," said Marvin. "It's rubbish."

"I know," said Marvin, "you keep going on about it. It sounds awful."

"Tell me," inquired Arthur, "do you get on well with other robots?"

"Don't blame you," said Marvin and counted five hundred and ninety­‐seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a second later.


# Chapter 22


The man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed.

"Fascinating trade," said the old man, and a wistful look came into his eyes, "doing the coastlines was always my favourite. Used to have endless fun doing the little bits in fjords..."

Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this.

"If you'd call it a robot," muttered Arthur. "It's more a sort of electronic sulking machine."

"Dent. Arthur Dent," said Arthur.

"Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent," said the old man, sternly. "It's a sort of threat you see." Another wistful look came into his tired old eyes. "I've never been very good at them myself, but I'm told they can be very effective."

Arthur blinked at him.

"We are going deep into the bowels of the planet where even now our race is being revived from its five­‐million­‐year slumber. Magrathea awakes."

"My name?" said the old man, and the same distant sadness came into his face again. He paused. "My name," he said, "... is Slartibartfast."


# Chapter 23


It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem.

The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double­‐backwards­‐somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the "Star Sprangled Banner", but in fact the message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish.


# Chapter 24


He closed his eyes in terror.

Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes.

"Earthman," he said, "we are now deep in the heart of Magrathea."

Arthur made nervous noises.

Slartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly. "It scares the willies out of me. Hold tight."

The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like.

"Welcome," said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, travelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into the mindboggling space, "welcome," he said, "to our factory floor."

Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror.

"No, we've been awakened to perform just one extraordinary commission for very... special clients from another dimension. It may interest you... there in the distance in front of us."

Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in that direction.

"Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact," said Slartibartfast cheerfully.

"Pity," said Slartibartfast, "that was one of mine. Won an award you know. Lovely crinkly edges."

"The mice were furious?"

"Look," said Arthur, "would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?"

"Earthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was destroyed five minutes before the completion of the purpose for which it was built, and we've got to build another one."

"Indeed Earthman."

"These creatures you call mice, you see, they are not quite as they appear. They are merely the protrusion into our dimension of vast hyperintelligent pan­‐dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese and the squeaking is just a front."

"You see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever hyperintelligent pan­‐dimensional beings. Your planet and people have formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten­‐million­‐year research programme..."

"Time," said Arthur weakly, "is not currently one of my problems."


# Chapter 25


On the day of the Great On­‐Turning two soberly dressed programmers with brief cases arrived and were shown discreetly into the office.

Their names were Lunkwill and Fook.

It said: "What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space have been called into existence?"

"I described myself as the second greatest," intoned Deep Thought, "and such I am."

"The Milliard Gargantubrain?" said Deep Thought with unconcealed contempt. "A mere abacus — mention it not."

"A five­‐week sand blizzard?" said Deep Thought haughtily. "You ask this of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang itself? Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff."

"The Great Hyperlobic Omni­‐Cognate Neutron Wrangler," said Deep Thought thoroughly rolling the r's, "could talk all four legs off an Arcturan MegaDonkey — but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards."

"I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons!" he boomed. "I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me!"

"I think this is getting needlessly messianic."

"O Deep Thought Computer," he said, "the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to tell us..." he paused, "... the Answer!"

"The answer?" said Deep Thought. "The answer to what?"

"Life!" urged Fook. "The Universe!" said Lunkwill. "Everything!" they said in chorus.

"Yes," said Deep Thought. "Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is an answer. But," he added, "I'll have to think about it."

"I am Majikthise!" announced the older one. "And I demand that I am Vroomfondel!" shouted the younger one.

"Alright!" bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk. "I am Vroomfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! What we demand is solid facts!"

Scarcely pausing for breath, Vroomfondel shouted, "We don't demand solid facts! What we demand is a total absence of solid facts. I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel!"

"We demand," yelled Vroomfondel, "that demarcation may or may not be the problem!"

"That's right!" shouted Vroomfondel, "we demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!"

"That's right!" agreed Majikthise. "You'll have a national Philosopher's strike on your hands!"

"Seven and a half million years," said Deep Thought.

"So long as you can keep disagreeing with each other violently enough and slagging each other off in the popular press, you can keep yourself on the gravy train for life. How does that sound?"


"Bloody hell," said Majikthise, "now that is what I call thinking. Here Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like that?"

# Chapter 27


Slartibartfast's study was a total mess, like the results of an explosion in a public library.

"Terribly unfortunate," he said, "a diode blew in one of the life­‐support computers. When we tried to revive our cleaning staff we discovered they'd been dead for nearly thirty thousand years. Who's going to clear away the bodies, that's what I want to know."

"Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest and Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known... The Time of Waiting is over!"

"Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this Great and Hopefully Enlightening Day!" cried the cheer leader. "The Day of the Answer!"

"For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little problems of Life, the Universe and Everything!"

"Seventy­‐five thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this program in motion," the second man said, "and in all that time we will be the first to hear the computer speak."

"Shhh," said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, "I think Deep Thought is preparing to speak!"

There was a moment's expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication channel.

"Good morning," said Deep Thought at last.

"Though I don't think," added Deep Thought, "that you're going to like it."

"You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought.

"Forty­‐two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.


# Chapter 28


"We're going to get lynched aren't we?" he whispered.

"Forty­‐two!" yelled Loonquawl. "Is that all you've got to show for seven and a half million years' work?"

"I checked it very thoroughly," said the computer, "and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is."

"Exactly!" said Deep Thought. "So once you do know what the question actually is, you'll know what the answer means."

"But I'll tell you who can," said Deep Thought.

"I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after me," intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones.

"A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate — and yet I will design it for you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix."

"And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten­‐million­‐year program! Yes! I shall design this computer for you. And I shall name it also unto you. And it shall be called... The Earth."

Phouchg gaped at Deep Thought.


# Chapter 29


"Zaphod! Wake up!"

"Mmmmmwwwwwerrrrr?"

"He got a double dose of the gas," said Trillian looking down at him, "two windpipes."

It was very yellow and very shiny, and when he breathed on it his breath evaporated off it in that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates off solid gold.

"Ah, shit," he said, "you wake me up from my own perfectly good dream to show me somebody else's."

"Very pretty," said Zaphod petulantly.

In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number. It said, Whatever your tastes, Magrathea can cater for you. We are not proud.

"I figure this," said Zaphod. "Whatever happened to my mind, I did it. And I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the government screening tests. And I wasn't to know anything about it myself. Pretty crazy, right?"

"What's all this?" said Trillian.

"That's it," said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls.

Zaphod shrugged.

"No," he said at last, "I don't seem to be letting myself into any of my secrets. Still," he added on further reflection, "I can understand that. I wouldn't trust myself further than I could spit a rat."

"The mice will see you now," he said.


# Chapter 30


"Deep Thought designed the Earth, we built it and you lived on it."

"And the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before the program was completed," added Arthur, not unbitterly.

"Well that's bureaucracy for you," he added.

"No," said the old man, "that's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the Universe has that."

"Maybe. Who cares?" said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited.

"Perhaps I'm old and tired," he continued, "but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied. Look at me: I design coastlines. I got an award for Norway."

"I've been doing fjords in all my life. For a fleeting moment they become fashionable and I get a major award."

"In this replacement Earth we're building they've given me Africa to do and of course I'm doing it with all fjords again because I happen to like them, and I'm old fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely baroque feel to a continent."

"Science has achieved some wonderful things of course, but I'd far rather be happy than right any day."

"It has already been hailed, so I gather, as the third most improbable event in the history of the Universe." "What were the first two?" "Oh, probably just coincidences," said Slartibartfast carelessly.

"I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," he muttered to himself.


# Chapter 31


It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated.

For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they came across — which happened to be the Earth — where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog.

"Arthur! You're safe!" a voice cried. "Am I?" said Arthur, rather startled. "Oh good."

"Well," said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, "our hosts here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being generally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to make it up to us."

A small voice said, "Welcome to lunch, Earth creature."

There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at Arthur.

Arthur gaped.

She looked him in the eye and Arthur thought he detected the tiniest resigned shrug.

"Could you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey?" she said.

Slartibartfast coughed politely.

"I'll just go and get on with some of my fjords then."

"Ah, well in fact that won't be necessary," said Frankie mouse. "It looks very much as if we won't be needing the new Earth any longer."

"Thank you Slartibartfast," said Benji firmly. "That will be all."

"Well, goodbye Earthman," he said to Arthur, "hope the lifestyle comes together."

"Now," said Benji mouse, "to business."

"And this is more or less the point — we're sick to the teeth with the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again on account of those whinnet­‐ridden Vogons quite frankly gives me the screaming heeby jeebies, you know what I mean?"

"Something that sounds good?" exclaimed Arthur. "An Ultimate Question that sounds good? From a couple of mice?"

The mice bristled.

"there comes a point I'm afraid where you begin to suspect that if there's any real truth, it's that the entire multi­‐dimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs."

"But..." started Arthur, hopelessly.

"In other words," said Benji, steering his curious little vehicle right over to Arthur, "there's a good chance that the structure of the question is encoded in the structure of your brain — so we want to buy it off you."

"No, no," said Frankie, "it's the brain we want to buy."

"Yeah," said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, "you'd just have to program it to say What? and I don't understand and Where's the tea? — who'd know the difference?"

With one more yank, Ford and Zaphod got the door open. On the other side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men who they could only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea. Not only were they ugly themselves, but the medical equipment they carried with them was also far from pretty."

So — Arthur was about to have his head cut open, Trillian was unable to help him, and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set upon by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than they were.

All in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every alarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting din.


# Chapter 32


"Damnation," muttered Frankie mouse, "all that fuss over two pounds of Earthling brain."

"The only thing we can do now," said Benji, crouching and stroking his whiskers in thought, "is to try and fake a question, invent one that will sound plausible."

Then Frankie said: "Here's a thought. How many roads must a man walk down?"

"Yes," he said, "that's excellent! Sounds very significant without actually tying you down to meaning anything at all. How many roads must a man walk down? Forty­‐two. Excellent, excellent, that'll fox 'em. Frankie baby, we are made!"

They performed a scampering dance in their excitement.

A voice on a loud hailer said, "OK Beeblebrox, hold it right there. We've got you covered."

"We don't want to shoot you, Beeblebrox!" shouted the figure. "Suits me fine!" shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap between two data process units.

"Hey, they're shooting at us," said Arthur, crouching in a tight ball, "I thought they said they didn't want to do that."

After a moment a voice replied, "It isn't easy being a cop!"

Ford shouted out, "Hey listen! I think we've got enough problems on our own having you shooting at us, so if you could avoid laying your problems on us as well, I think we'd all find it easier to cope!"

"Now see here, guy," said the voice on the loud hailer, "you're not dealing with any dumb two­‐bit trigger­‐pumping morons with low hairlines, little piggy eyes and no conversation, we're a couple of intelligent caring guys that you'd probably quite like if you met us socially!"

"I don't go around gratuitously shooting people and then bragging about it afterwards in seedy space­‐rangers bars, like some cops I could mention! I go around shooting people gratuitously and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend!"

"And I write novels!" chimed in the other cop. "Though I haven't had any of them published yet, so I better warn you, I'm in a meeeean mood!"

Ford's eyes popped halfway out of their sockets. "Who are these guys?" he said. "Dunno," said Zaphod, "I think I preferred it when they were shooting."

"We didn't enjoy doing that at all," shouted the other cop. "We could tell," shouted Ford.

"Now either you all give yourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course because we are firmly opposed to needless violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possibly one or two others we noticed on our way out here!"

"Because there are some things you have to do even if you are an enlightened liberal cop who knows all about sensitivity and everything!"

The heat and noise was quite fantastic. Slowly, the computer bank was beginning to disintegrate. The front had almost all melted away, and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding their way back towards where they were squatting. They huddled further back and waited for the end.


# Chapter 33


But the end never came, at least not then.

"Right," said Ford, "I'm going to have a look." He glanced round at the others. "Is no one going to say, No you can't possibly, let me go instead?" They all shook their heads.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. 

This struck Ford as being extremely odd.

"Let's get shot out of this hole," said Zaphod. "If whatever I'm supposed to be looking for is here, I don't want it." He grabbed the second Kill­‐O­‐Zap gun, blasted a perfectly harmless accounting computer and rushed out into the corridor, followed by the others.


# Chapter 34


R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more than say five minutes late.

R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast.

In his experience the Universe simply didn't work like that.

"Don't feel you have to take any notice of me, please," came a muffled drone.

"But how are you, metalman?" said Ford. "Very depressed."

"What's up?" "I don't know," said Marvin, "I've never been there."

"It's a very effective way of being wretched," said Marvin. "Don't pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me."

"I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it," said Marvin. "And what happened?" pressed Ford. "It committed suicide," said Marvin


# Chapter 35


That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light years between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the small palm tree on the bridge trying to bang his brain into shape with massive Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters

"The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases."

"OK baby, hold tight," said Zaphod. "We'll take in a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."



##########################################



## THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE


There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.


# Chapter 1


In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.

Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure.

The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call The Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.

And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet — especially by the strange ape­‐like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program.

Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he had hitherto claimed; and, more to the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying saucers.

And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship is moving slowly towards them.


# Chapter 2


Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not by reliable witnesses.

In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you would have to go inside and look at a Vogon.

If you are wise, however, this is precisely what you will avoid doing because the average Vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish you had never been born — or (if you are a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never been born.

Anatomical analysis of the Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver.

This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, and he was it who had had the job of demolishing the so­‐called "planet" Earth.

Aesthetics and technology were closed books to him and, had he had his way, burnt and buried books as well.

It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and this was certainly true in his case. 

When he heard the words "integrity" or "moral rectitude", he reached for his dictionary, and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he reached for the rule book and threw it away.

"Computer," he croaked, "get me my brain care specialist on the line."

"Well," he said, "hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and how are we feeling today?"

"Well," he said, "I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a Vogon, you know? The natural and healthy channelling of the aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence."

For an instant Halfrunt's smile flickered.

"Ah, no," said Halfrunt, "in my profession you know, we do not make personal friends." "Ah," grunted the Vogon, "professional detachment." "No," said Halfrunt cheerfully, "we just don't have the knack."

"But Beeblebrox, you know," he said, "he is one of my most profitable clients. He had personality problems beyond the dreams of analysts."

"Well," said Halfrunt brightly, "Zaphod's just this guy, you know?"

The Vogon Captain pressed a communicator button which connected him with the remains of his crew. "Attack," he said.

The Heart of Gold's Improbability Drive made it the most powerful and unpredictable ship in existence. There was nothing it couldn't do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen.

"Starpox!" he shouted.

Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin in search of a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon with a great deal of optimism

"Share and Enjoy," the machine replied and provided him with yet another cup of the sickly liquid.

The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local language, to read "Go stick your head in a pig", and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration.

"Ah," said Arthur, "so I'm a masochist on diet am I?"

"You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?" "Er, yes. With milk."


# Chapter 3


"Does anyone have a kettle?" Arthur asked as he walked on to the bridge

"Hey, didja hear that?" muttered Zaphod as he leapt now for the manual controls of the Infinite Improbability Drive, "the monkey spoke!"

Arthur gibbered.

He started to speak, and stopped. He started to speak again and stopped again. Finally he managed to speak. "Er," he said.

"What have you done to it, Monkeyman?" he breathed.

As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to start firing.

"Dying for a cup of tea, eh?" he said.

Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on.

Outside, the thunderous roar of the Definit­‐Kil cannon continued to rip at the force­‐field.

"Yeah. Listen, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third..." "What?" "There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine.

The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a far corner where Marvin the Paranoid Android sat slumped, ignoring all and ignored by all, in a private and rather unpleasant world of his own.

"Ah," he snapped. "Zaphod Beeblebrox. The last of our great line. Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth."

"We've been following your progress with considerable despondency..."

Zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and wondered if he shouldn't just jump over and have done with it.

"But I was President of the Galaxy, man!"

Ford nodded despondently.

"It is trying," said Zaphod with wonderful restraint, "to make tea."

"Oh, and Zaphod?" "Er, yeah?" "If you ever find you need help again, you know, if you're in trouble, need a hand out of a tight corner..." "Yeah?" "Please don't hesitate to get lost."


# Chapter 4


On the delivery plate of the Nutri­‐Matic Drink Synthesizer was a small tray, on which sat three bone china cups and saucers, a bone china jug of milk, a silver teapot full of the best tea Arthur had ever tasted, and a small printed note saying "Wait".


# Chapter 5


Ursa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in the known Universe.

It is a West Zone planet which by an inexplicable and somewhat suspicious freak of topography consists almost entirely of sub­‐tropical coastline. By an equally suspicious freak of temporal relastatics, it is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before the beach bars close.

Most particularly it shines on a building, a tall beautiful building consisting of two thirty­‐storey white towers connected by a bridge half­‐way up their length.

It is of course that invaluable companion for all those who want to see the marvels of the known Universe for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day — The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

If you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard you would enter the Lalamatine district of shops, bolonut trees and pavement cafes where the UM­‐Betans come to relax after a hard afternoon's relaxation on the beach.

He fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses.

They were a double pair of Joo Janta 200 Super­‐Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which had been specially designed to help people develop a relaxed attitude to danger. At the first hint of trouble they turn totally black and thus prevent you from seeing anything that might alarm you.

"Worst thing that ever happened to the Guide, moving to Ursa Minor Beta," he grumbled, "they've all gone soft."

He sat still and ignored the thought furiously. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He gave in to it. What the hell, he thought, go with the flow.


# Chapter 6


"Hello? Yes? Megadodo Publications, home of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the most totally remarkable book in the whole of the known Universe, can I help you?"

It adored working for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it just wished there was some way of keeping all the hitch­‐hikers away. Weren't they meant to be hanging round dirty spaceports or something?

"Yes, I passed on your message to Mr. Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now."

"The Guide is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate."

they claimed that the first version of the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing, summoned a qualified poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth, truth beauty and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party was Life itself for failing to be either beautiful or true.

"Look," said Zaphod, "I'm up to here with cool, OK? I'm so amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat inside me for a month. I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis."

"This cat's on an intergalactic cruise... in his office?" 

"Listen, three eyes," he said, "don't you try to outweird me. I get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal."

Zaphod leaned forward, conspirationally.

"Mr. Beeblebrox, sir," said the insect in awed wonder, "you're so weird you should be in movies."

"Yes, sir," it snapped, "can I help you?" "I doubt it," said Marvin.

"No one can help me," intoned Marvin.

"Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal..."

With a grinding of gears Marvin turned and trundled off. 

"One moment I was sitting in your ship feeling very depressed, and the next moment I was standing here feeling utterly miserable."

"Oh, fine," said Marvin, "if you happen to like being me which personally I don't."

"May I ask you," inquired the elevator in its sweetest, most reasonable voice, "if you've considered all the possibilities that down might offer you?"

Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall. He didn't need this, he thought to himself, this of all things he had no need of.

Most of all he didn't want to be standing in an office block arguing with an elevator.

"Holy Zarquon," muttered Zaphod, "did I ask for an existentialist elevator?" 

"Afraid?" cried Zaphod, "Of what? Heights? An elevator that's afraid of heights?"

Modern elevators are strange and complex entities.

An impoverished hitch­‐hiker visiting any planets in the Sirius star system these days can pick up easy money working as a counsellor for neurotic elevators.

"Left in the lurch by a lift," muttered Zaphod, who was feeling at his least jaunty.

"I'm dead certain this building shouldn't be shaking," Zaphod said.

He walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because at that moment his Joo Janta 200 Super­‐Chromatic Peril Sensitive sunglasses had turned utterly black.

"Who in the Galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company?"

"Beeblebrox, over here!" he shouted. Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the building. "No," called Zaphod, "Beeblebrox over here!"

"Do you know," Zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived, "your building's being bombed?" The man indicated his awareness.

"Frogstar Fighters!" muttered Zaphod, "Zarquon!"


# Chapter 7


"Let me introduce myself," the man said, "My name is Roosta, and this is my towel."

"And me," said Marvin in a soft low voice, "with this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side."

"How do you think I feel?" said Marvin bitterly.

"What a depressingly stupid machine," said Marvin and trudged away.


# Chapter 8


"So, do we just sit here, or what?" said Zaphod angrily, "what do these guys out here want?" "You, Beeblebrox," said Roosta, "they're going to take you to the Frogstar — the most totally evil world in the Galaxy."

"They're taking the building," said Roosta, "we're airborne."

"If I ever meet myself," said Zaphod, "I'll hit myself so hard I won't know what's hit me."

Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod accusingly, slumped in a corner and switched himself off.

The left­‐hand tower of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices streaked through interstellar space at a speed never equalled either before or since by any other office block in the Universe.

"The yellow stripes are high in protein, the green ones have vitamin B and C complexes, the little pink flowers contain wheatgerm extracts."

"They're going to feed you," said Roosta, "into the Total Perspective Vortex!"

"Listen!" said Roosta urgently, "you can kill a man, destroy his body, break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can annihilate a man's soul! The treatment lasts seconds, but the effect lasts the rest of your life!"

"Phreeow!" admitted Zaphod, much impressed.


# Chapter 9


The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale and unwholesome.

This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the reputation of being the most totally evil place in the Galaxy. From without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet across. From within it was something more monstrous than the mind can comprehend.

"The building will shortly be landing. When you leave the building, do not go out of the door," said Roosta, "go out of the window."

They never landed on Frogstar World B. No one did. No one ever walked on its surface other than the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex.

As he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs, his eyes smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin.

"Hey, er..." he stammered.

"I am Gargravarr. I am the Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex."

Zaphod nodded. He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses again.

"I am here," said the voice slowly, "my body wanted to come but it's a bit busy at the moment. Things to do, people to see." After what seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh it added, "You know how it is with bodies."

"I'll hum for you," said Gargravarr, "follow the humming."


# Chapter 10


The Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big place, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend to ignore.

For when you are put into the Vortex you are given just one momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of creation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot, which says "You are here."

"Hey, what was that?" he muttered voicelessly. "A recording," said Gargravarr, "of the last man who was put in the Vortex. It is always played to the next victim. A sort of prelude."

"couldn't we maybe slope off to a party or something for a while, think it over?" "For all I know," said Gargravarr's ethereal voice, "I'm probably at one. My body that is. It goes to a lot of parties without me. Says I only get in the way. Hey ho."

"I think we are probably not very well suited," said Gargravarr again at length, "we never seemed to be happy doing the same things. We always had the greatest arguments over sex and fishing. Eventually we tried to combine the two, but that only led to disaster, as you can probably imagine."

"Pizpot," said the voice, "My name is Pizpot Gargravarr. Says it all really doesn't it?"

"Errr..." said Zaphod sympathetically.

At that moment another dismal scream rent the air and Zaphod shuddered.

"The Universe," said Gargravarr simply, "the whole infinite Universe. The infinite suns, the infinite distances between them, and yourself an invisible dot on an invisible dot, infinitely small."

After five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was there in the box with him.


# Chapter 11


The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses.

it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation — every sun, every planet, their orbits, their composition and their economic and social history from, say, one small piece of fairy cake.

The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so basically in order to annoy his wife.

Trin Tragula — for that was his name — was a dreamer, a thinker, a speculative philosopher or, as his wife would have it, an idiot.

To Trin Tragula's horror, the shock completely annihilated her brain; but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion.

Zaphod shrugged smugly. "It just told me what I knew all the time. I'm a really terrific and great guy. Didn't I tell you, baby, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox!"

The elation of his recent experience was still with him though. The whole Universe. He had seen the whole Universe stretching to infinity around him — everything. And with it had come the clear and extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it.

Having a conceited ego is one thing. Actually being told by a machine is another.

"Nine hundred years..." he breathed to himself. That was how late the ship was.

"The statistical likelihood," continued the autopilot primly, "is that other civilizations will arise. There will one day be lemon­‐soaked paper napkins. Till then there will be a short delay. Please return to your seat."

Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered. His mouths said foolish things. He dropped into a chair.

Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled.

He smiled the smile that Zaphod had wanted to hit and this time Zaphod hit it.

"hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me you don't even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am."

"I know how you feel," said Zaphod, "I'm so great even I get tongue­‐tied talking to myself."

A green blur watched them disapprovingly. It coughed. "Good evening, madam, gentlemen," it said, "do you have a reservation?"

In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows disdainfully, this is what the green blur now did.

Arthur Dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath.

"... and the Universe," concluded the waiter, determined not to be deflected on his home stretch, "will explode later for your pleasure."

In an extraordinary gesture which is pointless attempting to describe, Zaphod Beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two of his arms and one of his thighs with the other.

"Yes sir," said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel, "this is Milliways — the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."

Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over to the bar and bought most of it.


# Chapter 15


One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broadminded and well­‐adjusted family can't cope with.

Most readers get as far as the Future Semi­‐Conditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up: and in fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.

This, even if the rest were true, which it isn't, is patently impossible, say the doubters.

All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in your own era, and when you arrive at the End of Time the operation of compound interest means that the fabulous cost of your meal has been paid for.

This, many claim, is not merely impossible but clearly insane

"If you've done six impossible things this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe?"


# Chapter 16


At the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt. His heads knocked together and his smiles were coming out of synch. He was miserably happy.

"Listen Ford," said Zaphod, "everything's cool and froody."

Zaphod giggled into his drink. It frothed up over the side of the glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top.

A wild­‐skinned sky­‐gypsy approached them and played electric violin at them until Zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed to go away again.

"Wowee," said Zaphod, "Zappo."

"At the End of the Universe you have to use the past tense a lot," said Zaphod

"Zowee," said Zaphod, "here we are at the End of the Universe and you haven't even lived yet. Did you miss out."

"That really huge number," he continued, "how does it go? 'Bwarm! Bwarm! Baderr!!' something, and in the stage act you do it ends up with this ship crashing right into the sun, and you actually do it!"

"Ship! Sun! Wham bang!" he cried. "I mean forget lasers and stuff, you guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and terrible songs."

"I am Mr. Desiato's bodyguard," it went, "and I am responsible for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away before it gets damaged."


# Chapter 17


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all.

Regular concert goers judge that the best sound balance is usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty­‐seven miles from the stage

whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments by remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the planet — or more frequently around a completely different planet.

Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the familiar theme of boy­‐being meets girl­‐being beneath a silvery moon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason.

Many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for artistic reasons, but most commonly because the band's public address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations treaties.

appointed Professor of Neomathematics at the University of Maximegalon, in recognition of both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax Returns, in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space­‐time continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent.

Ford waggled his head noncommittally.

"He's spending a year dead for tax reasons."

"Would you like to see the menu?" he said, "or would you like to meet the Dish of the Day?" "Huh?" said Ford. "Huh?" said Arthur. "Huh?" said Trillian. "That's cool," said Zaphod, "we'll meet the meat."

In a small room in one of the arms of the Restaurant complex a tall, thin, gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion looked him in the face.

He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on his features went off to play somewhere more healthy. 

"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "The Universe as we know it has now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour. So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe!"

"I've just come straight from the very very other end of time, where I've been hosting a show at the Big Bang Burger Bar — where I can tell you we had a very exciting evening ladies and gentlemen — and I will be with you right through this historic occasion, the End of History itself!"

"ladies and gentlemen," he breathed, "the candles are lit, the band plays softly, and as the force­‐shielded dome above us fades into transparency, revealing a dark and sullen sky hung heavy with the ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see we're all in for a fabulous evening's apocalypse!"

"For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the end of the tunnel," he said, "this is it." The band struck up again.

A large dairy animal approached Zaphod Beeblebrox's table, a large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips.

"Good evening," it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, "I am the main Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my body?"

It harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at them.

Its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger from Zaphod Beeblebrox.

"That's not the point," Arthur protested. Then he thought about it for a moment. "Alright," he said, "maybe it is the point. I don't care, I'm not going to think about it now. I'll just... er..."

The Universe raged about him in its death throes.

"A green salad," said Arthur emphatically.

"A green salad?" said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly at Arthur.

"A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good," it said, "I'll just nip off and shoot myself." He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur. "Don't worry, sir," he said, "I'll be very humane."

"Hey, Earthman," said Zaphod with a malicious grin on the face that wasn't stuffing itself, "what's eating you?"

For an infinite number of miles in every direction the universal cataclysm was gathering to a stupefying climax.

"And now, ladies and gentlemen," he beamed, "is everyone having one last wonderful time?" "Yes," called out the sort of people who call out "yes" when comedians ask them if they're having a wonderful time.

"And as the photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing to tear apart the last of the red hot suns, I know you're all going to settle back and enjoy with me what I know we will find all an immensely exciting and terminal experience."

"Believe me, ladies and gentlemen," he said, "there's nothing penultimate about this one."

"This," he said, "really is the absolute end, the final chilling desolation, in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes extinct. This ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial 'it'."

"And for once," he cried cheerily, "you don't need to worry about having a hangover in the morning — because there won't be any more mornings!"

"And finally," said Max, quieting the audience down and putting on his solemn face, "finally I believe we have with us here tonight, a party of believers, very devout believers, from the Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon."

The party of Zarquon's followers sat rigid, refusing to be buffeted by the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over them.

Ford gave him a three­‐Pan­‐Galactic­‐Gargle­‐Blaster look, in other words a rather unsteady one.

"I see." "You don't see. You don't see at all. I haven't got to the clever bit yet. You want to hear the clever bit?" "Tell me the clever bit." "I'll tell you the clever bit." Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit was.

One of his minds raced. The other dawdled lovingly over the food it was still shovelling in.

"I am not," said the waiter, "personally acquainted with the metal gentlemen in question, sir..."

"But I am informed that he has been awaiting your return for a considerable number of millennia."

"Left here?" said Zaphod, "are you being strange? We only just arrived here." "Indeed, sir," persisted the waiter doggedly, "but before you arrived here, sir, I understand that you left here."

"Put your analyst on danger money, baby," advised Zaphod.

"Listen you semi­‐evolved simian," cut in Zaphod, "go climb a tree will you?"

"Go bang your heads together four­‐eyes," he advised Zaphod.

"No, no," the waiter said to Zaphod, "your monkey has got it right, sir."

Arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing apposite, or indeed coherent.

"You jumped forward... I believe five hundred and seventy­‐six thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place," explained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling that he had finally won through against what had seemed to be insuperable odds.

They all agreed this was very neat.

"Whatever happened to Marvin?" said Trillian.

"Shee, you guys are so unhip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off."

"Hey, Marvin, is that you?" said Zaphod into the phone, "How you doing, kid?" There was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line. "I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said.

"Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to..."

"Yeah, yeah," sympathized Zaphod hardly at all.

"I can even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water? I've got one ready. Wait a minute."

"What's he saying?" asked Trillian. "Nothing," said Zaphod, "he just phoned up to wash his head at us."

In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw down the phone and wrote "Hotblack Desiato" on the bill.

"But what about the End of the Universe? We'll miss the big moment." "I've seen it. It's rubbish," said Zaphod, "nothing but a gnab gib." "A what?" "Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let's get zappy."

"Well," said Max beaming cheerfully at them, "it's too late to worry about whether you left the gas on now."


# Chapter 18


A Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter took them down deep into the substrata beneath the Restaurant. They were glad to see it had been vandalized and didn't try to make them happy as well as take them down.

The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete wall with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for all of fifty major lifeforms. Nevertheless, like every car park in the Galaxy throughout the entire history of car parks, this car park smelt predominantly of impatience

"Suit yourself," said Zaphod and turned away to ogle the ships.

"Five hundred and seventy­‐six thousand million, three thousand five hundred and seventy­‐nine years," said Marvin, "I counted them."

"The first ten million years were the worst," said Marvin, "and the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of decline."

"You don't like talking to me do you?" said Marvin in a low desolate tone. Trillian talked to Arthur instead.

"Zaphod," he said in a quiet voice, "just look at some of these little star trolleys..."

Zaphod whistled appreciatively.

"Amazing looking ship though. Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow."

Zaphod's attention however was elsewhere. His attention was riveted on the ship standing next to Hotblack Desiato's limo. His mouths hung open.

"It's so... black!" said Ford Prefect, "you can hardly make out its shape... light just seems to fall into it!"

Zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a man possessed — or more accurately like a man who wanted to possess.

"it's just totally frictionless. This must be one mother of a mover..."

"You mean... er..." Ford looked over his shoulder. "You mean stroll off with it? You think we should?" "No." "Nor do I." "But we're going to, aren't we?" "How can we not?"

Slowly, laboriously, and with a million little clanking and creaking noises that he had learned to simulate, Marvin turned round to answer the summons.

"Sounds awful," Marvin said.

"Well I wish you'd just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm," said Marvin, "because I haven't got one."

"Don't mention it," said Marvin, "Oh, you didn't." He trudged away again.

In the Restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment after which there wouldn't be any more moments.

All eyes were fixed on the dome, other than those of Hotblack Desiato's bodyguard, which were looking intently at Hotblack Desiato, and those of Hotblack Desiato himself which the bodyguard had closed out of respect.

His bodyguard was not a man which improved with proximity. 

Hotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing.

"The skies begin to boil!" he cried. "Nature collapses into the screaming void! In twenty seconds' time, the Universe itself will be at an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!"

At the back of the Restaurant the stony­‐faced party from the Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying.

Zarquon coughed. He peered round at the assembled gathering. The stars in his eyes blinked uneasily. He handled the microphone with confusion. "Er..." he said, "hello. Er, look, I'm sorry I'm a bit late. I've had the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment."

He seemed nervous of the expectant awed hush. He cleared his throat. "Er, how are we for time?" he said, "have I just got a min — " And so the Universe ended.


# Chapter 19


One of the major selling point of that wholly remarkable travel book, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, apart from its relative cheapness and the fact that it has the words DON'T PANIC written in large friendly letters on its cover, is its compendious and occasionally accurate glossary.

However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero.

From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.


# Chapter 20


The Restaurant continued existing, but everything else had stopped.

"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect.

"Every time you try to operate on of these weird black controls that are labelled in black on a black background, a little black light lights up black to let you know you've done it. What is this? Some kind of galactic hyperhearse?"

"Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different wavelengths," offered Trillian.

"Perhaps," said Marvin, "he was feeling very depressed."

"Take it easy," pleaded Arthur, "you're making me space sick." "Time sick," said Ford, "we're plummeting backwards through time." "Thank you," said Arthur, "now I think I really am going to be ill."

Arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm.

"Forty­‐two!" he cried.

"We have a thing on Earth..." began Arthur. "Had," corrected Zaphod. "... called tact. Oh never mind."

"Stay out of this Marvin," he said, "this is organism talk."

"You mean," said Arthur, "you mean you can see into my mind?" "Yes," said Marvin. Arthur stared in astonishment. "And...?" he said. "It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small."

"Making it up?" said Marvin, swivelling his head in a parody of astonishment, "Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it."

"I could tell you weren't really interested," murmured Marvin to himself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off.

Zaphod shrugged. "Time is bunk," he said.


# Chapter 21


Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in the middle of the vast Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound system.

They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area's giant control ship which hung in orbit some four hundred miles above the surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound system from there. Anyone within five miles of the speaker silos wouldn't have survived the tuning up.

If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos then his expiring thought would have been that in both size and shape the sound rig closely resembled Manhattan.

Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship, the massive photon­‐ajuitar, the bass detonator and the Megabang drum complex. It was going to be a noisy show.

"It means," said Marvin, "that the ship os going to dive into the sun. Sun... Dive. It's very simple to understand. What do you expect if you steal Hotblack Desiato's stunt ship?"

"This is awful," said Arthur unnecessarily in the pause which followed. "That's what I said," confirmed Marvin.

"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die." "I wish you'd stop saying that," said Ford.

The sun of Kakrafoon loomed terrifyingly large on the vision screen, its blazing white inferno of fusing hydrogen nuclei growing moment by moment as the ship plunged onwards, unheeding the thumping and banging of Zaphod's hands on the control panel.

Arthur and Trillian had the fixed expressions of rabbits on a night road who think that the best way of dealing with approaching headlights is to stare them out.

"Ford," he said, "how many escape capsules are there?" "None," said Ford. Zaphod gibbered. "Did you count them?" he yelled. "Twice," said Ford

"Where," said Ford Prefect quietly, "does it say teleport?" "Well, just over here in fact," said Arthur, pointing at a dark control box in the rear of the cabin, "Just under the word 'emergency', above the word 'system' and beside the sign saying 'out of order'."

"Hell's donkeys," muttered Zaphod

"Hey, Marvin kid," said Zaphod brightly, "how you doing?" "Very badly I suspect," muttered Marvin.

Those­ — very few — who witnessed the event and survived swear that the whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose into the air like a mile­‐thick pancake, flipped itself over and fell back down. 

Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A few sceptical scientists examined the records of the events more closely, and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a vast artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a nearby region of space.


# Chapter 22


Arthur woke up and instantly regretted it. 

Hangovers he'd had, but never anything on this scale. This was it, this was the big one, this was the ultimate pits. Matter transference beams, he decided, were not as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the head.

And what about matter transference beams? Any form of transport which involved tearing you apart atom by atom, flinging those atoms through the sub­‐ether, and then jamming them back together again just when they were getting their first taste of freedom for years had to be bad news.

Arthur span round and wobbled uncertainly.

"I think we're in a spaceship of some kind," he said.

"Do what I do." "What?" "Don't think about it." Arthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw the wisdom of it, tucked it up and put it away.

Fear gripped them.

Ford shivered, partly with the cold, but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle high to an Arcturan Megagrasshopper

However ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their death hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay any money you liked it wasn't with hessian wall weave.

Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two dozen overweight men and women pounded past them in track suits panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon gibber.

Ford Prefect stared after them. "Joggers!" he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed away up and down the network of corridors.

The first thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a coffin. And the next four thousand nine hundred and ninety­‐nine things that hit their eyes were also coffins.


# Chapter 23


On closer inspection the coffins seemed to be more like sarcophagi. They stood about waist high and were constructed of what appeared to be white marble, which is almost certainly what it was — something that only appeared to be white marble.

To Arthur they looked like the footprints of a spider that had had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on a night out, but Ford instantly recognized an early form of Galactic Eezeereed.

"It says 'Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven, Telephone Sanitizer Second Class' — and a serial number." "A telephone sanitizer?" said Arthur, "a dead telephone sanitizer?" "Best kind."

"This one's a dead hairdresser. Hoopy!"

"Why," said Arthur Dent, "isn't anyone ever pleased to see us?"

His displeasure was communicated partly by the barking hectoring quality of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he waved a long silver Kill­‐O­‐Zap gun at them. The designer of the gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush. "Make it evil," he'd been told.

"Make it totally clear that this gun has a right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things are going badly for them. If that means sticking all sort of spikes and prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it."

"This is not a gun for hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it is a gun for going out and making people miserable with."

Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily.

"Out," he said. People who can supply that amount of fire power don't need to supply verbs as well. Ford and Arthur went out, closely followed by the wrong end of the Kill­‐O­‐Zap gun and the buttons.


# Chapter 24


"Er, captain..." "Yes, Number One?" "Just heard a sort of report thingy from Number Two." "Oh, dear."

at a speed that he couldn't quite remember at the moment, but he knew it was terribly fast. It was something approaching the speed of something or other, or was it three times the speed of something else? Jolly impressive anyway.

He wasn't panicking. As far as he was concerned everything was going splendidly. He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy sponge.

Nice chap, Number One. Not of the very brightest, had the odd spot of difficulty doing up his shoe laces, but jolly good officer material for all that. The Captain wasn't a man to kick a chap when he was bending over trying to do up his shoe laces, however long it took him.

No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath.

The bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough hewn blue water crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the Maximegalon Museum of Diseased Imaginings.

An intestinal jumble of plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave; the taps and shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump.

A large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above the rim of the monstrous bath. "Ah, hello, Number Two," said the Captain, waving a cheery sponge, "having a nice day?"

Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion. "Er... hello," they said.

"Oh, hello there," he said to them, "Excuse me not getting up, having a quick bath. Well, jynnan tonnyx all round then."

something like 85% of all known worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee­‐N'N­‐T'N­‐ix, or jinond­‐o­‐nicks, or any one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic theme.

Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend too many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs.

"Oh no, no, no," said the Captain, "I expect they just dropped in for a quick jynnan tonnyx, don't you?"

"But sir, they're my prisoners! I must interrogate them!" The Captain looked at them doubtfully. "Oh all right," he said, "if you must. Ask them what they want to drink."

Arthur blinked. "What? Oh, er, yes," he said.

"Push off, would you, there's a good chap. I'm trying to have a relaxing bath."

If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal, you were suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard line rather than, as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering fangs.

"May I remind you sir," hissed Number Two at the Captain, "that you have now been in that bath for over three years?!"

He wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully, he grinned. It was safe.

The Captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be playing with a rubber duck.

Ford did something he very rarely did. He blinked.

"Oh yes," said the Captain, "Millions of them. Hairdressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, management consultants, you name them. We're going to colonize another planet."

Ford wobbled very slightly.

Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around the bath. The Captain let out a sigh of pleasure.

"Trouble with a long journey like this," continued the Captain, "is that you end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets terribly boring because half the time you know what you're going to say next."

"Oh yes," said the Captain, "well everyone said, very nicely I thought, that it was very important for morale to feel that they would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a good haircut and where the phones were clean."

For a moment the Captain did not answer. He twisted round in his bath and gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards the bright galactic centre. He squinted into the inconceivable distance.

"Errrrrrrrrrrr..." said Number Two.

"It's probably time I was getting out of this bath in fact. Oh, I don't know though, why stop just when I'm enjoying it?"

"So we're actually going to land in a minute?" "Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land as such, no... er..."

Ford exploded. "You're a load of useless bloody loonies!" he shouted.


# Chapter 25


which enabled the people of Golgafrincham to rid themselves of an entire useless third of their population. The other two­‐thirds stayed firmly at home and lived full, rich and happy lives until they were all suddenly wiped out by a virulent disease contracted from a dirty telephone.


# Chapter 26


That night the ship crash­‐landed on to an utterly insignificant little green­‐blue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western spiral arm of the Galaxy.

When the sun came up that morning it shed its thin watery light over a vast area heaving with wailing hairdressers, public relations executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing their way desperately to dry land.

A less strong minded sun would probably have gone straight back down again

"Filthy dirty trick to pull," muttered Arthur. Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged. "An imaginative solution to a problem I'd have thought," he said.

Arthur looked at him as if he'd gone mad and, seeing nothing to indicate the contrary, realized that it would be perfectly reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened.

"In an infinite Universe anything can happen," said Ford, "Even survival. Strange but true."

"We're in trouble," said Ford. "Oh," said Arthur. This sounded like month­‐old news to him.


# Chapter 27


Zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him.

"You," he spat. He staggered to his feet and stomped off to find a chair to slump into. He found one and slumped into it.

"He's a very stupid man," said Zaphod, "who wants to meet the man who rules the Universe." "Ah," said Trillian taking the bottle from Zaphod and helping herself, "a social climber."


# Chapter 28


To summarize: it is a well known fact, that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.

To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.

To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a problem.

And so this is the situation we find: a succession of Galactic Presidents who so much enjoy the fun and palaver of being in power that they very rarely notice that they're not.


# Chapter 29


On a small obscure world somewhere in the middle of nowhere in particular — nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it is protected by a vast field of unprobability to which only six men in this galaxy have a key — it was raining.

"I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to judge?"

He paused again. Sometimes he would pause for days, just to see what it was like.

"Do you think they came today?" he said, "I do. There's mud on the floor, cigarettes and whisky on the table, fish on a plate for you and a memory of them in my mind. Hardly conclusive evidence I know, but then all evidence is circumstantial."

"Weird," said Zaphod.

"But it's in the middle of nowhere," said Trillian, "we must have come to the wrong place. You can't rule the Universe from a shack."

"Do you rule the Universe?" said Zaphod. The man smiled at him. "I try not to," he said

"Are you wet?" Zaphod looked at him in astonishment. "Wet?" he cried, "Doesn't it look as if we're wet?" "That's how it looks to me," said the man, "but how you feel about it might be an altogether different matter."

"Hey, er..." said Zaphod, "what's your name?" The man looked at them doubtfully. "I don't know. Why, do you think I should have one? It seems very odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name."

"Wowee!" said Zaphod, "the seat of power!" He tickled the cat.

"Listen," said Zarniwoop, "I must ask you some questions." "Alright," said the man kindly, "you can sing to my cat if you like."

"How can I tell," said the man, "that the past isn't a fiction designed to account for the discrepancy between my immediate physical sensations and my state of mind?"

"Out there?" said the man, "out where?" "Out there!" said Zarniwoop pointing at the door. "How can you tell there's anything out there," said the man politely, "the door's closed."

"I only decide about my Universe," continued the man quietly. "My Universe is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay."

"I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?"

"My cat," said the man benignly, picking it up and stroking it, "I call him The Lord. I am kind to him."

"It merely pleases me to behave in a certain way to what appears to be a cat."

One of the men, who had been standing slightly forward of the rest of the group and who might therefore have been their leader, stepped forward. His face was quiet and calm, almost serene. "Ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh," he said quietly.

This caught Arthur by surprise. He had grown so used to receiving an instantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he heard via the Babel Fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to be aware of it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by the fact that it didn't seem to be working.

"Ruurgggghhhh urrgggh; urgh urgh (uh ruh) rruurruuh ug," continued the man­‐creature.

"Look at it this way," Ford Prefect had said, "fruit and berries on strange planets either make you live or make you die. Therefore the point at which to start toying with them is when you're going to die if you don't. That way you stay ahead. The secret of healthy hitch­‐hiking is to eat junk food."

"Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and says do what you like guys, oh, but don't eat the apple. Surprise surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting 'Gotcha'."

They decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear that they were grateful simply to be left alone.

Life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a while at least they were able to cope with the problems of aimlessness and isolation by deciding to ignore them.

When the craving for company became too great they would know where to find it, but for the moment they were happy to feel that the Golgafrinchans were hundreds of miles behind them.

Ford Prefect began to use his Sub­‐Etha Sens­‐O­‐Matic more often again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was so faint and from such enormous distance that it depressed him more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken.


# Chapter 31


His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it hadn't got anything to say yet and shut it again. His brain then started to contend with the problem of what his eyes told it they were looking at, but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth which promptly fell open again.

The thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a network of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the surface.

It was an old face, thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind. It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on.


# Chapter 32


A thin whine filled the air. It whirled and howled through the trees upsetting the squirrels. A few birds flew off in disgust. The noise danced and skittered round the clearing. It whooped, it rasped, it generally offended.

To those who said that they had a feeling soap wasn't found in mines, the Captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was because no one had looked hard enough, and this possibility had been reluctantly acknowledged.

Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the bagpipes, increasing the Captain's already considerable pleasure at the thought that any moment now they might stop.

The only thing nicer than a phone that didn't ring all the time (or indeed at all) was six phones that didn't ring all the time (or indeed at all).

The Captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak. The afternoon committee meetings were his favourite.

The talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent, except for the bagpiper who seemed to be in some wild and uninhabitable musical world of his own.

Ford dropped down out of the tree. "Hi there," he said.

"Address the chair!" snapped the management consultant. "There isn't chair," explained Ford, "there's only a rock."

A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it. "Shut up, you two," she said, "I want to table a motion." "You mean boulder a motion," tittered a hairdresser.

"When you've been in marketing as long as I have you'll know that before any new product can be developed it has to be properly researched. We've got to find out what people want from fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them."

The crowd were tense. They were expecting something wonderful from Ford. "Stick it up your nose," he said. "Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know," insisted the girl, "Do people want fire that can be applied nasally?"

"Almighty Zarquon," he said, "have none of you done anything?"

Number Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the bath.

He leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while he got it, or at least the best silence he could hope for under the circumstances: the circumstances were that the bagpiper was spontaneously composing a national anthem.

"And blown up a few military installations." The Captain leaned forward out of his bath. "Military installations Number Two?" he said. For a moment the eyes wavered. "Yes sir, well potential military installations. Alright... trees."

"And," he roared, "we interrogated a gazelle!"

"They're not cavemen." "They look like cavemen." "Do they live in caves?" "Well..." "They live in huts." "Perhaps they're having their caves redecorated," called out a wag from the crowd.

"Dying out!" repeated Ford. "Do you know what that means?" "Er... we shouldn't sell them any life insurance?" called out the wag again.

"He's got a very strong angle on it, you know, the burden of responsibility, the loneliness of command..." The Captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment. "Well, I wouldn't overstress that angle, you know," he said finally, "one's never alone with a rubber duck."

He held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from the crowd.

"Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich."

"But we have also," continued the Management Consultant, "run into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current going rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship's peanut."

"So in order to obviate this problem," he continued, "and effectively revaluate the leaf, we are about to embark on a massive defoliation campaign, and... er, burn down all the forests. I think you'll all agree that's a sensible move under the circumstances."

"You're all mad," explained Ford Prefect. "You're absolutely barmy," he suggested. "You're a bunch of raving nutters," he opined.

The crowd muttered to itself in annoyance. People as rich as they had suddenly become shouldn't be obliged to listen to this sort of gibberish. Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and he would go away.


# Chapter 33


It was not going well.

"I'm trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble," he said.

"Mean?" said Arthur, "Mean? You know perfectly well what it means. It means that this planet is the Earth! It's my home! It's where I was born!" "Was?" said Ford. "Alright, will be."

Arthur winced.

"No," said Ford, "there's nothing we can do. This doesn't change the history of the Earth, you see, this is the history of the Earth. Like it or leave it, the Golgafrinchans are the people you are descended from."

The only moral it is possible to draw from this story is that one should never throw the letter Q into a pivet bush, but unfortunately there are times when it is unavoidable.

"They've been outevolved by telephone sanitizers."

"Probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again, poor bastard. I keep on telling him there's only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc."

They looked over his shoulder. Their eyes popped. There amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid out in a clear straight line. They spelt two words. The words were these: "Forty­‐Two."

"Totally mad," he said, "utter nonsense. But we'll do it because it's brilliant nonsense."


# Chapter 34


"Does it worry you that you don't talk any kind of sense?" asked Agda.

"Oh, I've heard of worse," said Ford, "I read of one planet off in the seventh dimension that got used as a ball in a game of intergalactic bar billiards. Got potted straight into a black hole. Killed ten billion people." "That's mad," said Mella. "Yes, only scored thirty points too."

"You're very strange," she said. "No, I'm very ordinary," said Arthur, "but some very strange things have happened to me. You could say I'm more differed from than differing."


"Ah, that I don't know about. It sounds like something from the book." "What book?" Arthur paused. "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," he said at last. "What's that?" "Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening. I don't think I'll be wanting it any more," said Arthur Dent.

## LIFE, THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING


# Chapter 1


The regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of Arthur Dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was.

It wasn't just that the cave was cold, it wasn't just that it was damp and smelly. It was the fact that the cave was in the middle of Islington and there wasn't a bus due for two million years.

He hadn't been blown up now for five years.

And as he watched, as he stared in wonder and excitement, a long silver ship descended through the warm evening air, quietly, without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology.

A ramp extended itself. Light streamed out. A tall figure appeared silhouetted in the hatchway. It walked down the ramp and stood in front of Arthur. "You're a jerk, Dent," it said simply.

Arthur boggled at it.

"Arthur Dent?" it said. Arthur nodded helplessly. "Arthur Philip Dent?" pursued the alien in a kind of efficient yap. "Er... er... yes... er... er," confirmed Arthur. "You're a jerk," repeated the alien, "a complete asshole." "Er..."

The creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on its clipboard and turned briskly back towards the ship.

Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was — indeed, is — one of the Universe's very small number of immortal beings.

Those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with it, but Wowbagger was not one of them. Indeed he had come to hate them, the load of serene bastards.

He had had his immortality thrust upon him by an unfortunate accident with an irrational particle accelerator, a liquid lunch and a pair of rubber bands.

and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o'clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul.

He would insult the Universe. That is, he would insult everybody in it. Individually, personally, one by one, and (this was the thing he really decided to grit his teeth over) in alphabetical order.

And so he started out. He equipped a spaceship that was built to last with the computer capable of handling all the data processing involved in keeping track of the entire population of the known Universe and working out the horrifically complicated routes involved.

He imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots in the sky like a child's numbered dots puzzle. He hoped that from some vantage point in the Universe it might be seen to spell a very, very rude word.

"Folfanga," it said. It beeped. "Fourth world of the Folfanga system," it continued. It beeped again. "Estimated journey time, three weeks," it continued further. It beeped again. "There to meet with a small slug," it beeped, "of the genus A­‐Rth­‐Urp­‐Hil­‐Ipdenu."


# Chapter 2


He had just had a wonderful idea about how to cope with the terrible lonely isolation, the nightmares, the failure of all his attempts at horticulture, and the sheer futurelessness and futility of his life here on prehistoric Earth, which was that he would go mad.

"I will go mad!" he announced. "Good idea," said Ford Prefect, clambering down from the rock on which he had been sitting. Arthur's brain somersaulted. His jaw did press­‐ups. "I went mad for a while," said Ford, "did me no end of good."

"I thought you must be dead..." he said simply. "So did I for a while," said Ford, "and then I decided I was a lemon for a couple of weeks. I kept myself amused all that time jumping in and out of a gin and tonic."

"The point is, you see," said Ford, "that there is no point in driving yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad. You might just as well give in and save your sanity for later." "And this is you sane again, is it?" said Arthur. "I ask merely for information."

He felt very strange. After nearly four years of total isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see Ford that he could almost cry. Ford was, on the other hand, an almost immediately annoying person.

"Very nice," said Ford, in reference to Arthur's cave. "You must hate it."

"The Guide says there is an art to flying," said Ford, "or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss." He smiled weakly. He pointed at the knees of his trousers and held his arms up to show the elbows. They were all torn and worn through.

He lowered his voice to a whisper. "I have detected," he said, "disturbances in the wash."

He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite like the wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point, but the wind was busy fooling around with some leaves a little way off.

"Eddies," said Ford, "in the space­‐time continuum."

Ford looked angrily at him. "Will you listen?" he snapped. "I have been listening," said Arthur, "but I'm not sure it's helped."

"The difficulty with this conversation," said Arthur after a sort of pondering look had crawled slowly across his face like a mountaineer negotiating a tricky outcrop, "is that it's very different from most of the ones I've had of late. Which, as I explained, have mostly been with trees."

"Arthur," said Ford. "Hello? Yes?" said Arthur. "Just believe everything I tell you, and it will all be very, very simple." "Ah, well I'm not sure I believe that."

"Why," he said, "is there a sofa in that field?" "I told you!" shouted Ford, leaping to his feet. "Eddies in the space­‐time continuum!" "And this is his sofa, is it?" asked Arthur, struggling to his feet and, he hoped, though not very optimistically, to his senses.

With a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock and plunged off in hectic pursuit of Ford Prefect and the irrational piece of furniture.

Arthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day was for once working out so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes ago he had decided he would go mad, and now he was already chasing a Chesterfield sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth.

Important facts from Galactic history, number one: (reproduced from the Siderial Daily Mentioner's Book of popular Galactic History.) The night sky over the planet Krikkit is the least interesting sight in the entire Universe.


# Chapter 3


It was a charming and delightful day at Lord's as Ford and Arthur tumbled haphazardly out of a space­‐time anomaly and hit the immaculate turf rather hard.

"What was that?" hissed Arthur. "Something red," hissed Ford back at him. "Where are we?" "Er, somewhere green." "Shapes," muttered Arthur. "I need shapes."

"What was that?" whispered Ford. Arthur looked up. "Something blue," he said. "Shape?" said Ford. Arthur looked again. "It is shaped," he hissed at Ford, with his brow savagely furrowing, "like a policeman."

"For those of you who've just tuned in, you may be interested to know that, er... two men, two rather scruffily attired men, and indeed a sofa — a Chesterfield I think?" "Yes, a Chesterfield." "Have just materialized here in the middle of Lord's Cricket Ground."

His face froze for a second or two and then began to do that terribly slow crashing trick which Arctic ice — floes do so spectacularly in the spring.

"And the other thing," said Ford, "is that you appear to have a bone in your beard." He tossed back his tea.

"Perhaps," he said, "I should..." "No," said Ford sharply. "What?" said Arthur. "Don't try and phone yourself up at home." "How did you know...?" Ford shrugged. "But why not?" said Arthur. "People who talk to themselves on the phone," said Ford, "never learn anything to their advantage."

"This is not my first temporal anomaly," he added.

A glummer look replaced the already glum look on Arthur Dent's face.

"So we're not home and dry," he said. "We could not even be said," replied Ford, "to be home and vigorously towelling ourselves off."

"This isn't my towel," said Arthur, who was rummaging in his rabbit­‐skin bag.

"I would like you to shut up about your towel," said Ford. "It isn't my towel," insisted Arthur, "that is the point I am trying to..." "And the time at which I would like you to shut up about it," continued Ford in a low growl, "is now."

Ford was beginning to behave rather strangely, or rather not actually beginning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in a way which was strangely different from the other strange ways in which he more regularly behaved. 

The cricket ball which had excited this reaction fell out of the sky and dropped neatly into Arthur's mysterious rabbit­‐skin bag. "Now I would say that that was also a very curious event," said Arthur, rapidly closing the bag and pretending to look for the ball on the ground.

"Oh," said the small boy, putting his head to one side and thinking about it. "What's your name?" "Dent," said Arthur, "Arthur Dent." "You're a jerk, Dent," said the boy, "a complete asshole."

"I think," said Ford in a tone of voice which Arthur by now recognized as one which presaged something utterly unintelligible, "that there's an SEP over there." He pointed. Curiously enough, the direction he pointed in was not the one in which he was looking.

Arthur nodded slowly, carefully and with an air of immense stupidity.

Arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind the temples which was a hallmark of so many of his conversations with Ford. His brain lurked like a frightened puppy in its kennel.

"An SEP," he said, "is something that we can't see, or don't see, or our brain doesn't let us see, because we think that it's somebody else's problem. That's what SEP means. Somebody Else's Problem. The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot."

"Exciting, isn't it?" said an apparition. The apparition wobbled in front of Arthur's eyes, though the truth of the matter is probably that Arthur's eyes were wobbling in front of the apparition. His mouth wobbled as well. "W... w... w... w..." his mouth said.

"I'm rather fond of cricket, though I wouldn't like anyone outside this planet to hear me saying that. Oh dear no."

"Hello, Earthman," said Slartibartfast.

"And there's nothing that depresses me more than seeing a planet being destroyed. Except possibly still being on it when it happens. Or," he added in an undertone, "hanging around cricket matches."

Ford was aggressively uninterested.

"What in the name of zarking fardwarks is the old fool doing?" exploded Ford.

They tried not to listen, but could not help noticing that Slartibartfast was querulously demanding that he be given the silver urn containing the Ashes, as they were, he said, "vitally important for the past, present and future safety of the Galaxy"

What happened next they could not ignore. With a noise like a hundred thousand people saying "wop", a steely white spaceship suddenly seemed to create itself out of nothing in the air directly above the cricket pitch and hung there with infinite menace and a slight hum.

They were robots, white robots. What was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared to have come dressed for the occasion. Not only were they white, but they carried what appeared to be cricket bats, and not only that, but they also carried what appeared to be cricket balls

"Get to the ship," shouted Ford. "I don't want to know, I don't want to see, I don't want to hear," he yelled as he ran, "this is not my planet, I didn't choose to be here, I don't want to get involved, just get me out of here, and get me to a party, with people I can relate to!"

"What I need," shouted Ford, by way of clarifying his previous remarks, "is a strong drink and a peer­‐group."

Arthur had adopted his normal crisis role, which was to stand with his mouth hanging open and let it all wash over him.

"They're playing cricket," muttered Arthur, stumbling along after Ford. "I swear they are playing cricket. I do not know why they are doing this, but that is what they are doing. They're not just killing people, they're sending them up," he shouted, "Ford, they're sending us up!"

The eleven white robots ascended through the seething cloud in a tight formation, and with a few last flashes of flame entered the bowels of their hovering white ship, which, with the noise of a hundred thousand people saying "foop", promptly vanished into the thin air out of which it had wopped.

"Ashes," said Arthur tersely. "The burnt remains of a cricket stump. It's a trophy. That..." he was panting, "is... apparently... what they... have come and taken." He shook his head very slightly as if he was trying to get his brain to settle down lower in his skull.

The Somebody Else's Problem field is much simpler and more effective, and what's more can be run for over a hundred years on a single torch battery. This is because it relies on people's natural disposition not to see anything they don't want to, weren't expecting, or can't explain.


The most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only partly like a spaceship with guidance fins, rocket engines and escape hatches and so on, and a great deal like a small upended Italian bistro.

"Arthur Philip Deodat?" asked the figure. The man, with horrified confusion in eyes, nodded feebly. "You're a no­‐good dumbo nothing," whispered the creature. "I thought you should know that before you went."

Since this Galaxy began, vast civilizations have risen and fallen, risen and fallen, risen and fallen so often that it's quite tempting to think that life in the Galaxy must be: (a) something akin to seasick — space­‐sick, time sick, history sick or some such thing, and (b) stupid.


# Chapter 4


Arthur lay in startled stillness on the acceleration couch. He wasn't certain whether he had just got space­‐sickness or religion.

"Nice mover," said Ford in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise the degree to which he had been impressed by what Slartibartfast's ship had just done, "shame about the decor."

For a moment or two the old man didn't reply. He was staring at the instruments with the air of one who is trying to convert fahrenheit to centigrade in his head whilst his house is burning down.

"It's a mistake to try and understand mathematics," he said, "they only worry me."

"Deep in the fundamental heart of mind and Universe," said Slartibartfast, "there is a reason." Ford glanced sharply around. He clearly thought this was taking an optimistic view of things.

Rafia­‐wrapped bottles lurked hideously in the shadows.

The fundamental heart of mind and Universe can take a running jump, he thought to himself, this is rubbish. 

"It's a strange thing," said Arthur quietly, "that the further and faster one travels across the Universe, the more one's position in it seems to be largely immaterial, and one is filled with a profound, or rather emptied of a..."

"Where are we going?" "We are going," said Slartibartfast, "to confront an ancient nightmare of the Universe." "And where are you going to drop us off?"

He dug out his copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and tipped through those parts of the index primarily concerned with sex and drugs and rock and roll.

"A curse has arisen from the mists of time," said Slartibartfast.

"Doom," said Slartibartfast.

"My doctor says that I have a malformed public­‐duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre," he muttered to himself, "and that I am therefore excused from saving Universes."

The Universe could not possibly work like that, he thought, cannot possibly. That, he thought to himself, would be as absurd as... he terminated that line of thinking. Most of the really absurd things he could think of had already happened.

"Bistromathics," he said. "The most powerful computational force known to parascience."


# Chapter 5


The Bistromatic Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about with Improbability Factors.

Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the behaviour of numbers.

Just as Einstein observed that time was not an absolute but depended on the observer's movement in space, and that space was not an absolute, but depended on the observer's movement in time, so it is now realized that numbers are not absolute, but depend on the observer's movement in restaurants.

The first non­‐absolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved. This will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up

The second non­‐absolute number is the given time of arrival, which is now known to be one of those most bizarre of mathematical concepts, a recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself.

Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part in many branches of maths, including statistics and accountancy and also form the basic equations used to engineer the Somebody Else's Problem field.

The third and most mysterious piece of non­‐absoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill, the cost of each item, the number of people at the table, and what they are each prepared to pay for.

They were never tested under laboratory conditions, of course, because they never occurred in laboratories — not in reputable laboratories at least.

Numbers written on restaurant bills within the confines of restaurants do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the Universe.


# Chapter 6


Arthur nodded wisely to himself. After a while he realized that this wasn't getting him anywhere and decided that he would say "what?" after all.

Arthur nodded again and looked round to Ford for help, but Ford was practising being sullen and getting quite good at it.

"On a waiter's bill pad," said Slartibartfast, "reality and unreality collide on such a fundamental level that each becomes the other and anything is possible, within certain parameters."

"Strange but true. At least, I think it's strange," he added, "and I'm assured that it's true."


# Chapter 7


The early morning's thinnest sliver of light appeared silently. Several billion trillion tons of superhot exploding hydrogen nuclei rose slowly above the horizon and managed to look small, cold and slightly damp.

There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there is the possibility of magic. Creation holds its breath. The moment passed as it regularly did on Squornshellous Zeta, without incident.

Fourteen hours later the sun sank hopelessly beneath the opposite horizon with a sense of totally wasted effort.

A mattress had just met a robot. "Hello, robot," said the mattress. "Bleah," said the robot and continued what it was doing, which was walking round very slowly in a very tiny circle.

The robot stopped and looked at the mattress. It looked at it quizzically. It was clearly a very stupid mattress. 

After what it had calculated to ten significant decimal places as being the precise length of pause most likely to convey a general contempt for all things mattressy, the robot continued to walk round in tight circles.

Very few things actually get manufactured these days, because in an infinitely large Universe such as, for instance, the one in which we live, most things one could possibly imagine, and a lot of things one would rather not, grow somewhere.

No one really knows what mattresses are meant to gain from their lives either. They are large, friendly, pocket­‐sprung creatures which live quiet private lives in the marshes of Squornshellous Zeta. Many of them get caught, slaughtered, dried out, shipped out and slept on.

"My name," said the mattress, "is Zem."

He resumed his walk, as if inspired by this conversational outburst to fresh heights of gloom and despondency. He plodded tenaciously. If he had had teeth he would have gritted them at this point. He hadn't. He didn't. The mere plod said it all.

The mattress flolloped around. This is a thing that only live mattresses in swamps are able to do, which is why the word is not in more common usage.

Marvin plodded.

"You have something on your mind, I think," said the mattress floopily. "More than you can possibly imagine," dreaded Marvin. "My capacity for mental activity of all kinds is as boundless as the infinite reaches of space itself. Except of course for my capacity for happiness."

"My capacity for happiness," he added, "you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first."

The mattress globbered. This is the noise made by a live, swamp­‐dwelling mattress that is deeply moved by a story of personal tragedy.

The mattress globbered again.

"Voon," said the mattress.

"You may not instantly see why I bring the subject up, but that is because my mind works so phenomenally fast, and I am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you. Let me give you an example. Think of a number, any number." "Er, five," said the mattress. "Wrong," said Marvin.

"I would like to say that it is a very great pleasure, honour and privilege for me to open this bridge, but I can't because my lying circuits are all out of commission. I hate and despise you all. I now declare this hapless cyberstructure open to the unthinkable abuse of all who wantonly cross her."

The mattress flurred and glurried. It flolloped, gupped and willomied, doing this last in a particularly floopy way. "Voon," it wurfed at last.

"wop" and a team of white robots descended from the sky like dandelion seeds drifting on the wind in tight military formation. For a sudden violent moment they were all there, in the swamp, wrenching Marvin's false leg off, and then they were gone again in their ship, which said "foop".

"You see the sort of thing I have to contend with?" said Marvin to the gobbering mattress.

Suddenly, a moment later, the robots were back again for another violent incident, and this time when they left, the mattress was alone in the swamp. He flolloped around in astonishment and alarm. He almost lurgled in fear.


# Chapter 8


"These, then," said the figure, speaking from an immensely comfortable chair, "were the Krikkit Wars, the greatest devastation ever visited upon our Galaxy."

The three pillars stood out clearly now, three pillars topped with two cross pieces in a way which looked stupefyingly familiar to Arthur's addled brain.

"Nothing is about to attack here," said Slartibartfast in a voice which unexpectedly trembled with emotion. "This is where it all started. This is the place itself. This is Krikkit."

He stared up into the sky. The sky, from one horizon to another, from east to west, from north to south, was utterly and completely black.


# Chapter 9


Whirrr. "Thank you for making a simple door very happy." "Hope your diodes rot." "Thank you. Have a nice day."

Whirrr. "It is my pleasure to open for you..." "Zark off." "... and my satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done." "I said zark off."

It sounded as if a hundred thousand people had said "wop", which puzzled him because he was the only person on the ship.

the renewed shock had nearly made him spill his drink. He drained it quickly before anything serious happened to it. He then had another quick one to follow the first one down and check that it was all right.

"I can't cope with it," he said darkly, and sent a third drink down to see why the second hadn't yet reported on the condition of the first.

He poured a drink down his other throat with the plan that it would head the previous one off at the pass, join forces with it, and together they would get the second to pull itself together. Then all three would go off in search of the first, give it a good talking to and maybe a bit of a sing

Trillian raised her eyebrows.

The chances of this happening are more or less one to infinity against. Little is known of how this came about because none of the geophysicists, probability statisticians, meteoranalysts or bizzarrologists who are so keen to research it can afford to stay there.

Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard.

One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It's no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't.

You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when you're halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it's going to hurt if you fail to miss it.

This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration. Bob and float, float and bob. Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself waft higher. Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful.

They are most likely to say something along the lines of, "Good God, you can't possibly be flying!" It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right.

Waft higher and higher. Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops breathing regularly. DO NOT WAVE AT ANYBODY.

There are private flying clubs you can join which help you achieve the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit and/or explain them at the crucial moments.

He leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like a man trying to unbend a corkscrew by telekinesis.

"I want you to imagine," said Zaphod to the group of white robots who swung round to stare at him at that point, "that I have an extremely powerful Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in my hand."

It was impossible to explain why, but their smooth and sleek white bodies seemed to be the utter embodiment of clean, clinical evil. From their hideously dead eyes to their powerful lifeless feet, they were clearly the calculated product of a mind that wanted simply to kill.

"I can't help noticing that you have parked your ship," he said with a nod of one of his heads in the appropriate direction, "through mine."

"We have come," rasped the robot, "for the Gold of the Bail." Zaphod nodded. He waggled his gun to invite further elaboration. The robot seemed to understand this. "The Gold Bail is part of the Key we seek," continued the robot, "to release our Masters from Krikkit."

Zaphod nodded again. "What are you talking about?" he said.

A slightly pained expression seemed to cross the robot's totally expressionless face.

"No," said the robot. "We are going to shoot you." "Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, waggling his gun. "Yes," said the robot, and they shot him. Zaphod was so surprised that they had to shoot him again before he fell down.


# Chapter 10


Arthur could almost imagine Paul McCartney sitting with his feet up by the fire on evening, humming it to Linda and wondering what to buy with the proceeds, and thinking probably Essex.

"The Masters of Krikkit," breathed Slartibartfast in sepulchral tones.

"The Masters of Krikkit," said Slartibartfast again, and if his breathing had been sepulchral before, this time he sounded like someone in Hades with bronchitis.

So why all this rasping lungwork from Slartibartfast which would seem more appropriate to a radio commercial for one of those nasty films about chainsaw operators taking their work home with them?

"The game you know as cricket," he said, and his voice still seemed to be wandering lost in subterranean passages, "is just one of those curious freaks of racial memory which can keep images alive in the mind aeons after their true significance has been lost in the mists of time."

"Of all the races on the Galaxy, only the English could possibly revive the memory of the most horrific wars ever to sunder the Universe and transform it into what I'm afraid is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game."

Arthur noticed that a couple of members of the party were now singing a different song. It came lilting back to them through the soft night air, and was a sweet romantic ballad which would have netted McCartney Kent and Essex and enabled him to put in a fair offer for Hampshire.

"Did you not learn Ancient Galactic History when you were a child?" "I was in the cybercubicle behind Zaphod," said Ford, "it was very distracting. Which isn't to say that I didn't learn some pretty stunning things."

The songwriter was referring to meeting with a girl not "under the moon" or "beneath the stars" but "above the grass", which struck Arthur a little prosaic. Then he looked up again at the bewildering black sky, and had the distinct feeling that there was an important point here

"They are hardly aware of the sky. It's as if they had a blind spot which extended 180 degrees from horizon to horizon. You see, the reason why they have never thought 'We are alone in the Universe' is that until tonight they don't know about the Universe. Until tonight."

Many speak of the legendary and gigantic Starship Titanic, a majestic and luxurious cruise-liner launched from the great shipbuilding asteroid complexes of Artifactovol some hundreds of years ago now, and with good reason.

They did not realize that because of the quasi-reciprocal and circular nature of all Improbability calculations, anything that was Infinitely Improbable was actually very likely to happen almost immediately.

but when launched, it did not even manage to complete its very first radio message — an SOS — before undergoing a sudden and gratuitous total existence failure.

the one which regularly commands the most actual astonishment was Krikkit One, the first spaceship ever built by the people of Krikkit. This is not because it was a wonderful ship. It wasn't. It was a crazy piece of near junk.

The period of time which had elapsed between the moment that the people of Krikkit had discovered that there was such a thing as space and the launching of their first spaceship was almost exactly a year.

"Extremely rickety" was one phrase which sprang to mind, and "Please may I get out?" was another.

"no way," he repeated, "does anyone design and build a ship like this in a year, no matter how motivated. I don't believe it. Prove it to me and I still won't believe it."

The darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple past them. It was a very cold darkness, a very blank and heavy darkness, it was the darkness of the night sky of Krikkit.

History was gathering itself to deliver another blow.

Still the darkness thrummed at them, the blank enclosing darkness. It seemed closer and closer, thicker and thicker, heavier and heavier. And suddenly it was gone. They flew out of the cloud. They saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite dust and their minds sang with fear.

For a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep of the Galaxy, itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the Universe. And then they turned round. "It'll have to go," the men of Krikkit said as they headed back for home.

On the way back they sang a number of tuneful and reflective songs on the subjects of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life and the obliteration of all other life forms.


# Chapter 11


"the whole population of Krikkit was transformed from being charming, delightful, intelligent..." "... if whimsical..." interpolated Arthur. "... ordinary people," said Slartibartfast, "into charming, delightful, intelligent..." "... whimsical..." "... manic xenophobes."

"The idea of a Universe didn't fit into their world picture, so to speak. They simply couldn't cope with it. And so, charmingly, delightfully, intelligently, whimsically if you like, they decided to destroy it."


# Chapter 12


"well, you know, they're just a bunch of real sweet guys, you know, who just happen to want to kill everybody. Hell, I feel the same way some mornings. Shit."

Thousands and thousands of huge Krikkit warships had leapt suddenly out of hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of major worlds, first seizing vital material supplies for building the next wave, and then calmly zapping those worlds out of existence.

"these guys are just obsessed." This too was true, and is the only explanation anyone has yet managed to come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the people of Krikkit had pursued their new and absolute purpose — the destruction of everything that wasn't Krikkit.

These had really struck terror into the hearts of everyone who had encountered them — in most cases, however, the terror was extremely short-lived, as was the person experiencing the terror.

Judiciary Pag gazed once more around the courtroom, wherein were assembled hundreds of the very highest officials of the entire Galactic administration, all in their ceremonial uniforms or bodies, depending on metabolism and custom.

This was the most momentous occasion in legal history, and Judiciary Pag knew it. He took out his chewing gum and stuck it under his chair.

He consulted a piece of paper which he found in the back pocket of his Judicial jeans. "They believe in 'peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life, and the obliteration of all other life forms'." He shrugged. "I've heard a lot worse," he said.

"Hey, is there something in this water?" he said. "Er, no, m'lud," said the Court Usher who had brought it to him, rather nervously. "Then take it away," snapped Judiciary Pag, "and put something in it."

The solution was brilliant, and went like this: The planet of Krikkit was to be enclosed for perpetuity in an envelope of Slo-Time, inside which life would continue almost infinitely slowly. All light would be deflected round the envelope so that it would remain invisible and impenetrable.

The Lock would be on an asteroid which would slowly orbit the envelope. The key would be the symbol of the Galaxy — the Wikkit Gate.


# Chapter 13


"a Krikkit warship which had been missing presumed destroyed turned out to be just missing after all. It appeared and tried to seize the Key."

"It's all right," she said in a voice which would have calmed the Big Bang down. "Apparently there was a short battle. The Key and the warship were disintegrated and blasted into the space-time continuum. Apparently they are lost for ever."


# Chapter 14


"Listen. The time streams are now very polluted. There's a lot of muck floating about in them, flotsam and jetsam, and more and more of it is now being regurgitated into the physical world. Eddies in the space-time continuum, you see."

"We are going," said Slartibartfast in a slow, measured voice, "to try to prevent the war robots of Krikkit from regaining the whole of the Key they need to unlock the planet of Krikkit from the Slo-Time envelope and release the rest of their army and their mad Masters."

"It's just," said Ford, "that you mentioned a party."

The more that Slartibartfast unravelled the dark and tragic story of Krikkit and its people, the more Ford Prefect wanted to drink a lot and dance with girls.

Slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement. He had been planning to learn to play the octraventral heebiephone — a pleasantly futile task, he knew, because he had the wrong number of mouths.

Instead, he had somehow got talked into doing some part-time work for the Campaign for Real Time and had started to take it all seriously for the first time in his life. As a result he now found himself spending his fast-declining years combating evil and trying to save the Galaxy.

"If everything you've shown us is true..." "True? Of course it's true." "... then we don't stand a whelk's chance in a supernova."

He paused to see if the matter was now cleared up. The freshly puzzled looks clambering across Arthur's face told him that it wasn't.

"The point is," he said, "that people like you and me, Slartibartfast, and Arthur — particularly and especially Arthur — are just dilletantes, eccentrics, layabouts, fartarounds if you like."

"We're not obsessed by anything, you see," insisted Ford. "..." "And that's the deciding factor. We can't win against obsession. They care, we don't. They win."

"I care about lots of things," said Slartibartfast, his voice trembling partly with annoyance, but partly also with uncertainty. "Such as?" "Well," said the old man, "life, the Universe. Everything, really. Fjords."


# Chapter 15


Time travel is increasingly regarded as a menace.

most of which is incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't spent at least four lifetimes studying advanced hypermathematics, and since it was impossible to do this before time travel was invented, there is a certain amount of confusion as to how the idea was arrived at in the first place.

One rationalization of this problem states that time travel was, by its very nature, discovered simultaneously at all periods of history, but this is clearly bunk. The trouble is that a lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as well.

It is certainly significant in that it was the single event which caused the Campaign for Real Time to be set up in the first place (or is it last? It depends which way round you see history as happening, and this too is now an increasingly vexed question).

Long after his death his poems were found and wondered over. News of them spread like morning sunlight. For centuries they illuminated and watered the lives of many people whose lives might otherwise have been darker and drier.

So a lot of history is now gone for ever. The Campaign for Real Timers claim that just as easy travel eroded the differences between one country and another, and between one world and another, so time travel is now eroding the differences between one age and another.


# Chapter 16


Arthur materialized, and did so with all the customary staggering about and clasping at his throat, heart and various limbs which he still indulged himself in whenever he made any of these hateful and painful materializations that he was determined not to let himself get used to.

He looked around for the others. They weren't there. He looked around for the others again. They still weren't there. He closed his eyes. He opened them. He looked around for the others. They obstinately persisted in their absence.

Someone or something, however, seemed to be expecting him, for at that moment there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie green neon sign. It said, silently: YOU HAVE BEEN DIVERTED

He hugged himself tightly in his dressing gown and shivered, nevertheless.

WELCOME, the sign now suddenly said. After a moment, it added: I DON'T THINK.

The stone-cold fear which had been hovering about Arthur all this time, waiting for its moment, recognized that its moment had now come and pounced on him.

The sign changed itself again. It said: DO NOT BE ALARMED. After a pause, it added: BE VERY VERY FRIGHTENED, ARTHUR DENT.

Once again it left him in darkness. His eyes seemed to be popping out of his head. He wasn't certain if this was because they were trying to see more clearly, or if they simply wanted to leave at this point.

there was an indescribably hideous monster standing quietly behind him. Arthur yawed wildly as his skin tried to jump one way and his skeleton the other, whilst his brain tried to work out which of his ears it most wanted to crawl out of.

"Bet you weren't expecting to see me again," said the monster, which Arthur couldn't help thinking was a strange remark for it to make, seeing as he had never met the creature before. He could tell that he hadn't met the creature before from the simple fact that he was able to sleep at nights.

A terrible cold calm came over him as he realized that what he was looking at was a six-foot-high hologram of a housefly.

"Or perhaps you remember me better," said the voice suddenly, and it was a deep, hollow malevolent voice which sounded like molten tar glurping out of a drum with evil on its mind, "as the rabbit."

"Born in darkness," rumbled the voice, "raised in darkness. One morning I poked my head for the first time into the bright new world and got it split open by what felt suspiciously like some primitive instrument made of flint. "Made by you, Arthur Dent, and wielded by you. Rather hard as I recall."

"You turned my skin into a bag for keeping interesting stones in. I happen to know that because in my next life I came back as a fly again and you swatted me. Again. Only this time you swatted me with the bag you'd made of my previous skin."

"Arthur Dent, you are not merely a cruel and heartless man, you are also staggeringly tactless."

and he would much rather have his original bag back, except that he was of course terribly sorry for having so peremptorily removed it, or rather its component parts, i.e. the rabbit skin, from its previous owner, viz. the rabbit whom he currently had the honour of attempting vainly to address.

All he actually managed to say was "Erp".

"The interesting thing about reincarnation," rasped the voice, "is that most people, most spirits, are not aware that it is happening to them." He paused for effect. As far as Arthur was concerned there was already quite enough effect going on. "I was aware," hissed the voice

"I could hardly help it, could I?" he bellowed, "when the same thing kept happening, over and over and over again! Every life I ever lived, I got killed by Arthur Dent. Any world, any body, any time, I'm just getting settled down, along comes Arthur Dent — pow, he kills me. Hard not to notice."

"'That's funny,' my spirit would say to itself as it winged its way back to the netherworld after another fruitless Dent-ended venture into the land of the living, 'that man who just ran over me as I was hopping across the road to my favourite pond looked a little familiar...'"

"And gradually I got to piece it together, Dent, you multiple-me-murderer!"

The corridor was dark and, briefly, silent. He was alone with his thoughts. They were extremely unpleasant thoughts and would rather have had a chaperone.

"If it was a coincidence, then my name," roared the voice, "is not Agrajag!!!" "And presumably," said Arthur, "you would claim that that was your name." "Yes!" hissed Agrajag, as if he had just completed a rather deft syllogism.

It was a Cathedral of Hate. It was the product of a mind that was not merely twisted, but actually sprained. It was huge. It was horrific.

The vast, incomprehensibly vast chamber looked as if it had been carved out of the inside of a mountain, and the reason for this was that that was precisely what it had been carved out of. It seemed to Arthur to spin sickeningly round his head as he stood and gaped at it.

the colours with which some of the unspeakable details were picked out ranged horribly across the whole spectrum of eye-defying colours from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead, taking in Liver Purple, Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow, Burnt hombre and Gan Green on the way.

The unspeakable details which these colours picked out were gargoyles which would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch. The gargoyles all looked inwards from the walls, from the pillars, from the flying buttresses, from the choir stalls, towards the Statue

Around the monumental walls were vast engraved stone tablets in memory of those who had fallen to Arthur Dent.

was the very clear implication that all these people and creatures were indeed the same person, over and over again. And it was equally clear that this person was, however unfairly, extremely upset and annoyed.

In fact it would be fair to say that he had reached a level of annoyance the like of which had never been seen in the Universe. It was an annoyance of epic proportions, a burning searing flame of annoyance, an annoyance which now spanned the whole of time and space in its infinite umbrage.

a statue of Arthur Dent, and an unflattering one. Fifty feet tall if it was an inch, there was not an inch of it which wasn't crammed with insult to its subject matter, and fifty feet of that sort of thing would be enough to make any subject feel bad.

From the small pimple on the side of his nose to the poorish cut of his dressing gown, there was no aspect of Arthur Dent which wasn't lambasted and vilified by the sculptor.

Arthur appeared as a gorgon, an evil, rapacious, ravenning, bloodied ogre, slaughtering his way through an innocent one-man Universe.

And when he opened his eyes again, there in front of him stood the figure of the man or creature, or whatever it was, that he had supposedly been persecuting all this time. "HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!" said Agrajag.

"Look...!" protested Arthur. "HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!!!" explained Agrajag, and Arthur reluctantly accepted this on the grounds that he was rather frightened by this hideous and strangely wrecked apparition.

His batwings were somehow more frightening for being the pathetic broken floundering things they were that if they had been strong, muscular beaters of the air. The frightening thing was probably the tenacity of his continued existence against all the physical odds.

He had the most astounding collection of teeth. They looked as if they each came from a completely different animal, and they were ranged around his mouth at such bizarre angles it seemed that if he ever actually tried to chew anything he'd lacerate half his own face along with it

"This is my last body. My last life. This is my revenge body. My kill-Arthur-Dent body. My last chance. I had to fight to get it, too."

"What have you got against me, Dent?" snarled the creature, advancing on him in a painful waddle.

"Nothing," insisted Arthur, "honestly, nothing." Agrajag fixed him with a beady stare. "Seems a strange way to relate to somebody you've got nothing against, killing them all the time. Very curious piece of social interaction, I would call that. I'd also call it a lie!"

"I got yanked involuntarily back into the physical world," pursued Agrajag, "as a bunch of petunias. In, I might add, a bowl. This particularly happy little lifetime started off with me, in my bowl, unsupported, three hundred miles above the surface of a particularly grim planet."

"Not a naturally tenable position for a bowl of petunias, you might think. And you'd be right. That life ended a very short while later, three hundred miles lower. In, I might add, the fresh wreckage of a whale. My spirit brother."

He glanced up again, and realized that the arm that had puzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into existence a bowl of doomed petunias. This was not a concept which leapt easily to the eye.

"I must go," insisted Arthur. "You may go," said Agrajag, "after I have killed you." "No, that won't be any use," explained Arthur, beginning to climb up the hard stone incline of his carved slipper, "because I have to save the Universe, you see."

Agrajag blinked slowly in a kind of frozen logical horror. "You haven't been to Stavromula Beta... yet?" he whispered.

"Oh, you go there all right," muttered Agrajag in a broken voice, "you go there all right. Oh zark!" he tottered, and stared wildly about him at his huge Cathedral of Hate. "I've brought you here too soon!"

"I'm going to kill you anyway!" he roared. "Even if it's a logical impossibility I'm going to zarking well try! I'm going to blow this whole mountain up!" He screamed, "Let's see you get out of this one, Dent!"

brought the strange monstrosity crashing down on top of the altar. Agrajag screamed again, thrashed wildly for a brief moment, and turned a wild eye on Arthur. "You know what you've done?" he gurgled painfully. "You've only gone and killed me again. I mean, what do you want from me, blood?"


# Chapter 17


"but then anyone who has been to any of the higher dimensions will know that they're a pretty nasty heathen lot up there who should just be smashed and done in, and would be, too, if anyone could work out a way of firing missiles at right-angles to reality."

The history of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of idealism, struggle, despair, passion, success, failure, and enormously long lunch-breaks.

the Holy Lunching Friars of Voondon (who claimed that just as lunch was at the centre of a man's temporal day, and man's temporal day could be seen as an analogy for his spiritual life, so Lunch should (a) be seen as the centre of a man's spiritual life, and (b) be held in jolly nice restaurants)

Anyone who even notices, let alone calls attention to, the curious but utter coincidental and meaningless fact that every world on which the Guide has ever set up an accounting department has shortly afterwards perished in warfare or some natural disaster, is liable to get sued to smithereens.

This is all for the best, because in the long run a good solid war is less psychologically damaging than a protracted game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket.


# Chapter 18


The land began to slide, and he suddenly felt the force of the word "landslide" in a way which had never been apparent to him before. It had always just been a word to him, but now he was suddenly and horribly aware that sliding is a strange and sickening thing for land to do.

Stones, then rocks, then boulders which pranced past him like clumsy puppies, only much, much bigger, much, much harder and heavier, and almost infinitely more likely to kill you if they fell on you.

The logic of the situation, i.e. that he was clearly bound to survive if the next foreshadowed incident in the saga of his inadvertent persecution of Agrajag was to happen, was utterly failing to impinge itself on his mind or exercise any restraining influence on him at this time.

He ran with the fear of death in him, under him, over him and grabbing hold of his hair.

directly in front of him a small navy-blue holdall that he knew for a fact he had lost in the baggage-retrieval system at Athens airport some ten years in his personal time-scale previously, and in his astonishment he missed the ground completely and bobbed off into the air with his brain singing.

he was flying. He glanced around him in surprise, but there could be no doubt that that was what he was doing. No part of him was touching the ground, and no part of him was even approaching it. He was simply floating there with boulders hurtling through the air around him.

Between him and the shivering ground were now some thirty feet of empty air, empty that is if you discounted the boulders which didn't stay in it for long, but bounded downwards in the iron grip of the law of gravity; the same law which seemed, all of a sudden, to have given Arthur a sabbatical.

with the instinctive correctness that self-preservation instils in the mind, that he mustn't try to think about it, that if he did, the law of gravity would suddenly glance sharply in his direction and demand to know what the hell he thought he was doing up there, and all would suddenly be lost.

He was flying, What was he going to do about it? He looked back down at the ground. He didn't look at it hard, but did his best just to give it an idle glance, as it were, in passing.

If he picked the bag up, could he carry it? Mightn't the extra weight just pull him straight to the ground? Mightn't the mere act of touching something on the ground suddenly discharge whatever mysterious force it was that was holding him in the air?

Mightn't he be better off just being sensible at this point and stepping out of the air, back on to the ground for a moment or two? If he did, would he ever be able to fly again?

He bobbed, he floated. He tried a little swoop. The swoop was terrific. With his arms spread out in front of him, his hair and dressing gown streaming out behind him, he dived down out of the sky, bellied along a body of air about two feet from the ground and swung back up again

He judged himself against the wind, pushed up against it and turned around. He floated on its body. He didn't realize, but his body was willoming at this point.

He felt the way he imagined an angel must feel during its celebrated dance on the head of a pin whilst being counted by philosophers.

Ten minutes later, drifting idly through a cloud, he got a large and extremely disreputable cocktail party in the small of the back.


# Chapter 19


The longest and most destructive party ever held is now into its fourth generation, and still no one shows any signs of leaving. Somebody did once look at his watch, but that was eleven years ago, and there has been no follow-up.

There have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds, and there is one theory that this is a battle being fought between the fleets of several rival carpet-cleaning companies who are hovering over the thing like vultures, but you shouldn't believe anything you hear at parties

One of the problems, and it's one which is obviously going to get worse, is that all the people at the party are either the children or the grandchildren or the great-grandchildren of the people who wouldn't leave in the first place

and because of all the business about selective breeding and regressive genes and so on, it means that all the people now at the party are either absolutely fanatical partygoers, or gibbering idiots, or, more and more frequently, both.

Either way, it means that, genetically speaking, each succeeding generation is now less likely to leave than the preceding one.

One of the things which seemed like a good idea at the time was that the party should fly — not in the normal sense that parties are meant to fly, but literally.

Not only that, but the flying party had also managed to arm itself rather heavily. If they were going to get involved in any petty arguments with wine merchants, they wanted to make sure they had might on their side.

It is one hell of a party. It is also one hell of a thing to get hit by in the small of the back.
